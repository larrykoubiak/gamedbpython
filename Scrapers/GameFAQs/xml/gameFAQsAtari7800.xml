		<Description>Ace of Aces puts you in the cockpit of the Mosquito, the maverick RAF fighter bomber of World War II. It's white-knuckle aerial combat simulation, combining the exhilaration of flight with the gut-wrenching pressure of enemy confrontation.

During World War II, Mosquitos downed 659 enemy aircraft and 500 V-1 Buzz Bombs. Your only allies are your wits, your weapons, and your radar. Are you equal to the challenge?

Down the Nazi bombers, sink the U-boats, outrun the V-1 Buzz Bombs and stop the enemy trains to release the POWs. Should you fly through a storm or around? Navigate carefully, consult your intelligence reports and maps to make a decision. Choose your weapons and fuel wisely--once you're on a mission there's no going back.

Select one mission or any combination. If you complete all four successfully--and make it back alive--you'll become the most distinguished flight veteran of World War II--the Ace of Aces!</Description>

		<Description>The year is 3097 ... you are the contestant in the fastest, most competitive, and by far the most popular sport in the universe. You and your opponent are strapped into Rotofoils™, hovercraft-like vehicles that skim the surface of the playfield at speeds of up to 50 meters a second. You objective is simple: score the most points during the timed competition and be declared the champion. Your task, however, is a bit more complex. At the speed you're traveling, firing the Plasmorb™ * through your opponent's goal takes more than just skill and timing.

Ballblazer features two-player simultaneous play, with first-person perspective for both players. Three playing modes are available: Regulation Game, Practice Mode, and Spectator Mode.

Ballblazer offers the type of two-player head-to-head competition you've been waiting for. Three minutes, two players, one victor!</Description>

Once you zero in on some fancy shooting scores, Gramps offers you a bonus round by tossing target bottles in the air.</Description>

The action begins at the sound of the bell. You shoot to center ice: take the puck across the blue line, and then weave and rush to outrace your challenger to the goal. He grabs the elusive puck and then it's up to you to hook it back. Sticks fly, he takes a shot off the boards.

The puck is yours again! Time is running out! You attempt the most powerful score in the game. Swing your stick back and -- slapshot! The goalie slips and looks in astonishment as the puck zips past him. It's your third goal! You've scored a Hat Trick!</Description>

		<Description>Impossible. It's been a long time since the Agency stamped a mission that way. (Back then, agents had numbers like 006 and 007.) But the Agency had never faced a foe like the fiendishly clever Elvin. Until now.

Your mission, Agent 4125 (we've lost an agent or two since 007), is to fall Elvin's horrible plots. From his underground laboratory, the nefarious scientist is holding the world's population hostage under the threat of nuclear annihilation. You must penetrate the rooms and tunnels of his stronghold, avoid his human-seeking robots, and search for the pieces of his security code.

Somersault over the robots or use a precious snooze code to deactivate them long enough to search each room. As you find code pieces, the Agency's computer will help you unscramble the passwords, or you can try to solve them yourself. You've got to reach Elvin's control center, but you'd better watch you step... They didn't stamp this impossible for nothing!</Description>

		<Description>A serious problem is blocking attempts to colonize the otherwise life-compatible planet Nebulus: it's water is poisonous! The only way to return the water to its harmless, natural form is to destroy the eight enormous towers that maintain a mysterious, lethal hold over all forms of this valuable resource.

Spurred to action by the needs of your dangerously overpopulated home planet, you must attempt to conquer these alien-forsaken relics once and for all. But it won't be easy! You'll have to climb each tower all the way to the top in order to detonate its vulnerable spot. And, succeeding towers are more difficult to topple!

You'll need all your wits about you to avoid huge, crushing boulders, giant eyes, and indestructible mutant molecules! And watch out for those slippery stairs and disintegrating ledges. One false step and you'll plummet to the depths below!</Description>

		<Description>You are challenging the torturous Pharonna River and must complete the treacherous course in the shortest time possible without wiping out. You must make split second decisions to increase or decrease boat speed while turning left and right according to the river flow to avoid obstacles, such as piers, boats, bouys, and logs. Careful! Don't crash because the water is infested with killer sharks and you will be just another delicious meal. You must manipulate the boat and skier correctly to jump the ramps for extra points or you will crash. Watch out for the banks and beaches. If you get too close, you will be wiped out! This is a world class championship course that defies and dares you to one quick run.</Description>

		<Description>A vicious band of roving hostile aliens has infested your planet's nine space stations. They are threatening the peace and security of your planet and the entire solar system.

It's up to you and the other members of your elite, interplanetary security force to regain control of the space stations. If you lose control of a vital station to the evil band, you have one last option. You must destroy the station entirely. To accomplish this final deed, you must find the secret code and take the code to the destruct console.

Play the game alone or with a friend. In a two-player game, each player has half the screen and controls a different member of the interplanetary security team. You can work together, level by level, to destroy the aliens in a space station, or work independently on different levels. Each space station has a different number of levels, from one to five.

During your adventure throughout each station, look for abandoned equipment and weapons. You can swap your Phaser for grenades and other more powerful weapons and gain added points, too! Explore the rooms on each level. Find food and sustenance to increase your health as you battle to win back those valuable space platforms.</Description>
