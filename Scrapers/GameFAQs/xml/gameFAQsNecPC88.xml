		<Description>You are Marty McFly, just a typical senior at Hill Valley High. But after getting behind the wheel of a nuclear-powered sports car turned time machine, you find yourself in the year 1955 where you've accidentally tampered with history. Now it must be corrected. You must somehow make sure that teenagers Lorraine Baines and George McFly (the two kids that will eventually grow up to become your parents) fall in love before the photo of your family fades away and you're left with nothing to come home to. It won't be easy. You'll have to protect George from Biff and his gang of bullies while doing your best to keep them from beating you up instead. To complicate things, Lorraine has a crush on you, so you'll have to dodge her advances while trying to figure out a way to get George and her to kiss at the school dance. Time is wasting and even if you manage to put all of the pieces in place, there is still no guarantee that you'll get back. It will all come down to one brief moment in time when the past, present and future all meet.</Description>

		<Description>Drift back to ancient Phoenicia and challenge yourself with Columns, a game favored by middle eastern merchants. In this mesmerizing pastime, tinker with your riches to align glittering jewels across, down, or diagonally. As you line up colors, the gems vanish and more sparklers drop from above. The challenge increases as the jewels fall more rapidly. You must quickly align them before the columns reach the top. You don't have to be a joystick whiz to excel, even at the hardest levels. Try Flash Columns and make a flashing jewel disappear before time runs out. Enjoy solitary games, or play with a friend. Imagine yourself on the warm Mediterranean coast, or drifting over a languid sea.

		<Description>Hackers beware! You're about to tee off on a course so challenging that it would've had history's greatest golfers trembling in their knickers. Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. And it has more doglegs than a kennel. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play. So get a grip on yourself. Then swing into action on a course as legendary as the man who designed it.</Description>

		<Description>We've been watching you...

We know all about you. We know your weaknesses. Weaknesses that have made you our thrall. To regain your freedom you must find the castle at the heart of the Labyrinth. If you are unable to break the spell within 13 hours, you will be lost forever. Which, for your information, is a very long time...

A key. Popcorn, A move ticket. Everyday objects have a way of taking on a whole new meaning once you enter the Labyrinth. Be prepared for anything. A wall of hands, talking door-knockers, or a friend in need. There will be goblins at every turn. Only one thing's for certain; we can't be held responsible if you get lost.</Description>

		<Description>Upon escaping the crumbling ruins of Shadowguard, the black fortress of Minax, you lay your weary body on the now-sacred ground. As you rest, you remember your first encounter with the evil wizard of Mondain, whom you later tracked down and destroyed. The existence of his apprentice, Minax, was soon revealed and the crusade was begun again. Younger and more cunning than her mentor, she has been much more difficult to vanquish. But now your sense of accomplishment is touched by a chilling fear. Have all vestiges of evil been removed? Somehow, you sense that your treacherous foes have not been eliminated. Without further feats of skill, daring and perseverance, all of your past accomplishments may be lost. You stand up, prepare your armor, and walk to the dimension door.
