Whether rescuing hostages from a terrorist prison or infiltrating the headquarters of an enemy unit, every mission takes careful planning and pinpoint execution. Drop caches of weapons and first aid supplies, outmaneuver the enemy, then locate the pick-up zone in order to reach safety!</Description>

		<Description>Armageddon Man casts you as the Supreme Commander of a future barely balanced Earth. The Earth has been split into 16 separate nuclear capable countries, such as the Black African Republic, Japan and European Unite, and it's your job to make sure it doesn't become lifeless.

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</Description>

Strange and fearsome creatures will attack me at every turn. But I will find weapons along the way: a ball and chain, a bow and arrow, or a mighty sword will be my defense! In the Fantasy World, I can put on wings and take to the sky, or become a mermaid to explore the ocean depths. There, the Goddess of Wisdom can become the Princess of Victory!</Description>

		<Description>You are Marty McFly, just a typical senior at Hill Valley High. But after getting behind the wheel of a nuclear-powered sports car turned time machine, you find yourself in the year 1955 where you've accidentally tampered with history. Now it must be corrected. You must somehow make sure that teenagers Lorraine Baines and George McFly (the two kids that will eventually grow up to become your parents) fall in love before the photo of your family fades away and you're left with nothing to come home to. It won't be easy. You'll have to protect George from Biff and his gang of bullies while doing your best to keep them from beating you up instead. To complicate things, Lorraine has a crush on you, so you'll have to dodge her advances while trying to figure out a way to get George and her to kiss at the school dance. Time is wasting and even if you manage to put all of the pieces in place, there is still no guarantee that you'll get back. It will all come down to one brief moment in time when the past, present and future all meet.</Description>

		<Description>Sick of silly old soccer? Tired of pathetic pinball? Then you need a dose of Ballistix - the fastest, wackiest, toughest ball game yet to appear on a computer. Ballistix just explodes with excitement, puzzles and an amazing 130 different screens of frenetic action! The aim of the game is simple: score more goals than your opponent to win the match. Doing it is a different matter as splitters fill the screen with dozens of balls, tunnels hide them from view, bumpers bounce balls all over the show, fiendish red arrows speed them up to almost impossible velocity, magnets pull them away from your control, and much, much more. You can play against the computer or another player, set the speed if you can't stand the pace, define where the balls are fired and their velocity, rack up bonuses that will get you extra goals and then, at the end of an exhausting game, set your name in pride of place on the high-score table.</Description>

		<Description>He's totally new. Totally tough. And he'll stop at nothing to make sure justice prevails! From the dark streets of GOTHAM CITY to the deepest corners of the criminal underworld comes the CAPED CRUSADER as you've never seen him before. Incredibly strong. Armed to the teeth. And ready to put his life on the line for the sake of all, on a search-and-destroy mission to end the Joker's reign of terror. He leaps, he flies, he dodges enemy fire and delivers it right back... with a vengeance. This is no kid stuff. This is as real as video gaming gets. If you liked what you saw in the movie, you're gonna love what you see here. Because this time around, BATMAN is all business, and he won't let anything stand in his way!</Description>

		<Description>The Penguin is back and he's set himself up as a respectable umbrella merchant. Or has he? Could the umbrella factory be just a cover for his plot to take over the world with an army of robotic penguins? As Batman you must match clues you've collected to locate the master computer and - POW! ZAP! CRUNCH! - put an end to the demented squawkings of that overweight birdbrain. But that's not all! As soon as you've taken care of the Penguin, the Joker pulls off his greatest feat of sleight of hand - he kidnaps Robin! At the scene of the crime you must gather all the facts. Then, while the trail is still hot, you're off on a crime-solving adventure. Grab your Batarang and rev up the Batmobile - because if you don't reach Robin in a hurry, the last laugh will be on you! HA! HA! HA! HA!</Description>

		<Description>In the mirror across the office I caught sight of my reflection. I looked like a deadbeat punk. That made me sore, real sore. So I pulled my rod and emptied six slugs into that ugly mug. It was a dumb thing to do but, hell, it made me feel better. Then the phone rang. I slammed one hand down on the edge of the receiver to make it flip into my hand. But something went wrong. The handset spun across the room and through the open window. I leaned out over the street below. The handset was hanging by its cord one floor down. So I figured I'd have to shout. "Spillade Investigations, whaddaya want" I yelled. It was the start of something big...</Description>

		<Description>Hey Dudes! You're going on a most excellent adventure through history. You know the whacked-out, time-warped trip we had in the movie. Now, in the Bill &amp; Ted's Most Excellent computer game, you'll meet some neat dead dudes, too - though you'll need more than two to pass that most heinous history exam!

At the Circle K, meet Rufus, an ultra-cool messenger and his time traveling phone booth. Just dial a year and take off in time. You're looking for a bodacious bunch of historical heavyweights to bring back to San Dimas High. This is an excellent arcade/action adventure, but only the coolest of dudes will be triumphant!

Can you find the answer for Socrates the philoso-fixer, take notes for Beethoven, fiddle with Nero and chill out with Joan of Arc (she's one hot chick, but it's "Miss of Arc" to you)? No way?! Yes, way! Genghis Khan likes Twinkies and Marie Antoinette is into cake, but how do you get Freud to leave his mother and get Mikey (Michaelangelo) off the ceiling? Don't forget that short, dead dude Napoleon, and there's Abe Lincoln and Billy the Kid. Plus, Uncle Al (relativ-ity) wanders randomly - hey, he's Einstein, whatcha gonna do!

The animation and graphics are incredible. There's stuff digitized right outta the movie and some really neat sounds. Whoa! There's even four levels of difficulty to make this totally not easy.

So be excellent to yourself and buy this computer game. Party on, dudes!</Description>

		<Description>For two years, your people have struggled against the relentless onslaught of invading forces. With your army reduced to a handful and your artillery depleted, further resistance seems impossible. But in a hidden underground laboratory, a team of scientists has at last perfected a new kind of fighting machinery: a bionic arm that extends and contracts, providing unheard of strength and maneuverability. Combined with an arsenal of rapid-fire, armor-piercing and heat-seeking weaponry, this will put the power of an entire army in the hands of one man... one carefully chosen soldier, who has what it takes to become a new breed of unstoppable commando... a Bionic Commando. And you are that soldier! Your mission will take you through the heavily-patrolled wilderness surrounding the enemy headquarters and into the very heart of the fortress itself. Even to the most courageous soldier, it would seem an impossible challenge. But there has never been a soldier like the Bionic Commando!</Description>

		<Description>Fight for victory in the hottest hockey game on ice! With sharpened blades and a lethal stick, you slash into a rink surrounded by thousands of screaming fans. It's time for full-speed, high contact hockey, the kind of bone-jarring action played by the pros. The puck is dropped, you take control, center it and... Whoa! Your opponent viciously checks you from behind, making an incredible steal. You charge after him, crushing him against the boards. Suddenly tempers flare, off come the gloves, and you're swinging fists like a prize fighter. What action! You can even rack up assists like the great you-know-who. Or play goalie in the slap shooting penalty scenes. So strap on Blades of Steel. And imagine those immortal words - "He shoots, he scores!"</Description>

		<Description>Sit back and get comfortable before you open this box. You might not be moving from your computer for a while, because once you start in with the 3D blocks, you'll be hooked! You'll begin with the playing pit, a 3D enclosure with length, width and depth that you can set. During the game, various 3D blocks will fall into the pit. Your job is to rotate and maneuver each of them into the proper position in order to form complete layers. As each layer is completed, it vanishes, giving you more points and more room to work. Blockout will challenge your reflexes and your resolve in a test of coordination and quick thinking. But the greatest challenge of all will be keeping yourself from playing it again and again.</Description>

Because BLOOD MONEY is simply the best arcade game you've ever seen. It has staggering graphics, amazing sound effects and music and the most gripping gameplay you've ever tackled in your life. BLOOD MONEY just leaves the competition for dead and takes you into new realms of arcade action. But it's going to be tough.

		<Description>Danger in the first degree. Open on a sultry, rather unremarkable big-city afternoon. Focus on a sweaty, sort of sloppy small-time PI's office. The drowsy detective is rudely jerked back to consciousness by his telephone's nasty jangle: "Sam, you're a dead man." Seems things have suddenly gotten very personal. A definitely unsettling how-do-you-do. But who in the world could be the perpetrator? And why? "Sam, you're a dead man." There are 20 serious suspects. And, unfortunately for Sam, it seems each one wants to throw the first clump of dirt on his coffin. "Sam, you're a dead man." A smart gumshoe will turn his old casefiles - and the city - upside down to find the fiend. A smarter gumshoe will also turn and constantly check his flanks. Seems Sam's been put in the rather precarious position of trying to skin a cat without getting skinned alive. "Sam, you're a dead man." And the one man who can help with a few precious clues and tidbits of info just happens to be blind. "Sam, you're a dead man." "Sam, you're a dead man." Guess who's Sam. Have a nice day.</Description>

		<Description>The race begins! Drive your race-tuned Baja Bug along the race track, passing through gates and collecting flags for points. Time gates give you an additional two seconds on the next leg so drive through them if you can. Collecting the flags in the specified order gives you extra points. Avoid hitting the fences, walls, trees and other obstacles as they'll flip your buggy over and slow you down. You are competing against the clock so don't waste time, push the pedal flat to the floor. Try jumping obstacles by hitting the logs that lie across the track. Show off your driving skills by running over molehills and tree stumps, tipping your car onto two wheels - see how long you can keep your buggy in this trick position. Now fasten your seatbelt for the ride of your life!</Description>

They buzz by and when the smoke clears, the passenger seat's bare. These dudes have kidnapped your baby, Bunny! Only you and the Buggy can bring her back. But not without a bone-bouncing chase that makes the Indy 500 look like bumper cars. Over jam-packed city streets and treacherous curves on mountain cliffs, past Dark Jackal's Bullies to catch his Buggy and Bunny. And the cops are bearing down on you from behind. Think you got what it takes to save Bunny?</Description>

		<Description>It's double fun and double trouble all the way in Captain Fizz, the most exciting simultaneous 2-player game you and a friend are ever likely to play. It's a whole new world of high-speed, split-screen action, as both of you take on the nasty Blaster-Trons infesting the planet Icarus. Yup, it's a tough mission all right, but you might just win out with the right blend of cooperation, courage, laser-hot reflexes, tactical sense and brains. There are 22 levels of savage and relentless action to battle through before you reach your objective, the central computer that's causing the evil infestation. You'll never get there, though, unless you put your heads together and cooperate; your buddy can't do it on his own and neither can you. This is one program where even the easy games are hard. So remember - united you stand, but divided you fall...</Description>

		<Description>Championship Baseball has it all. You begin by drafting a team. Look over the talent pool. You'll need starting pitchers, relievers, infielders, outfielders, even utility players for bench strength. Consider each player's talents carefully before putting them on your team. Once you've selected your team, set your batting order. Then choose which of the four divisions suits you, and play ball! Championship Baseball gives you more options. You may want to start with some batting practice to master the fine art of hitting a screwball. Then, challenge a friend or the computer to 9 innings of intense action. When you're ready, pick your team and enter the 4-division, 24-team race for the pennant! You control all the action - pitching, hitting, catching, outfield relays, base running, even sliding under tags. All in the most realistic baseball simulation you can find!</Description>

		<Description>And now we proudly present the Sultans of Slam. The Champs of Chokes. The meanest, nastiest, foulest fighters the canvas has ever seen. We bring you the guys who use every dirty trick known to man, and a few that aren't! Take on any 8 rowdy wrestlers, each with his own individual style when it comes to busting heads. Use leg drops, spin kicks, body slams, rope bouncing, a flying drop kick, a suplex, an airspin, even the famous atomic drop to mangle those dudes. You'll need over 200 stitches if you don't. The crowd will cheer. They'll boo. They'll egg you on, or simply throw eggs instead. The scoring is based on the complexity of your moves and, of course, your strength. And one day, probably long after your poor battered head resembles an over-cooked cabbage, you'll be good enough to win the title. And the coveted "Championship Wrestling Belt" will be yours!</Description>

Chubby's one passion is FOOD and on this heaven-on-earth mission nothing will stop him as he bounces his way through screen after screen of grub; munching his way to the ultimate one-ton mark. Chubby Gristle is a classic platform game with danger at every turn. Will he become a one-ton giant or will  he end up at the health farm or gym? His future is in your hands!</Description>

For cartoonist Jack Deebs, who's been carried across the boundary, it's a wild and amazing place; and he's discovered that only some of the Doodles are friendly. Take Holli Would. She's a knockout Doodle who's really interested in Jack. She's interested in using him to get herself and real body and transfer into this world. She just needs to get her hands on one special piece of magic.
The Golden Spike of Power, hidden atop the Ocean Hotel in Las Vegas, is the powerful wedge between Cool World and this world. And Holli's trying to steal it. If she removes it, she may destroy both her world and Jack's. As Jack, you're got to stop her from doing it -- because you know she will if she can!</Description>

One at a time they venture into danger. It's up to you and your trusty crossbow to protect them along their treacherous path. And if one succumbs to the scorpions, stalactites, fireballs, or man-eating plants that block his way, the next adventurer arrives to take his place. Save as many brave explorers as you can! Once you overcome all the early hazards, you will arrive at the castle. Here your skill, courage - and aim - are truly challenged. So grab your crossbow and let the tale unfold!</Description>

		<Description>After you saved the entire city of Phlan and located the Pool of Radiance, a simple trip to Tilverton should have been as easy as a noon-day stroll. But it wasn't...
Ambushed, captured, and knocked unconscious, you awake with no idea who attacked you or how you arrived in Tilverton. You only know that five azure-blue symbols are imprinted just under the skin of your right arm.
The mystical power of the azure symbols ensnares your will like metal bonds! And when the bonds glow, you must do as they command. No magic dispels the bonds and no cleric's prayers remove them.
Your only hope: search the Forgotten Realms for members of the alliance who created the bonds and regain control of your own destiny. Only then can you be free of the Curse of the Azure Bonds.</Description>

		<Description>Can you survive the haunted house on the hill? From the moment the creaking drawbridge closes behind you until you slay the Black Knight, Dark Castle is a non-stop life and death adventure. Pitting you against the evil that threatens you at every turn, Dark Castle requires that you think quick, act fast and have a real zest for life. Where will your adventure take you? Through dungeons, laboratories and caves. Up and down ladders and ropes. Over trap doors. Past whip-cracking henchmen and Merlin the Magician, all of whom kill first, then ask questions. By creepy crawlers, kamikazee vultures and other mutants of mischief. And the more elusive you are, the more difficult it gets. Dark Castle has you looking over your shoulder as soon as your hunt for the Black Knight begins. Are you a hero? Or are you history?</Description>

		<Description>The big screen classic, in which modern day vigilante Paul Kersey wreaks his own form of revenge on the scum and filth that terrorize the streets of modern day New York. For too long the gangs have run wild, unchallenged in their merciless attacks and violations of innocent citizens. Muggings and robberies have become a daily feature of city life. So when the chief of police turns a blind eye you decide to take over where the law left off. Strap on your famous 475 WILDEY MAGNUM. Turn yourself into a one-man fighting force armed with pump-action shotgun, machine gun and rocket launcher. Now turn the tables on the punks and creeps who certainly know how to dish out the violence but may not be so good at being on the receiving end.</Description>

Read maps, plan raids, even team with Robin Hood, then plunder enemy strongholds, dueling for gold needed to build an army of mercenary vassals. You'll also need to stash cash for catapults that launch boulders, fire and disease into formidable fortresses. So wise up and rise up to this unique challenge where leadership is as important as swordmanship. For when you've survived this strategic adventure, complete with daring jousts and courageous castle sieges, you won't be sorry - you'll be king!</Description>

Crutchfield Manor is no ordinary home sweet home. There are surprises around every corner. Secret passageways, hidden doors... dead ends. Peculiar pets like mutant mice and killer canaries stalk the halls and lurk in dark corners. But you can concoct some ingenious schemes to uncover clues, solve puzzles and recover the jewels. You can stack books on candlesticks, climb to the top of a grandfather clock, move bookcases, slide paintings, balance on champagne glasses or billiard balls. In fact, you'll do just about anything to get the job done! Loaded with surprises, The Hidden Diamond Caper is addictive, puzzle-solving fun.</Description>

Mankind needs you, the 'Dominator'... You need to fight... IT NEEDS TO FEED...</Description>

		<Description>You're the only soul in a twilight zone that's like nowhere you've ever been before. It's a space station in the middle of nowhere... an eerie world full of deadly surprises... a time bomb of explosive vapors. And your mission is to find out what makes it tick and avert impending disaster before it's too late. All you've got to do is drill and release the volatile vapors brewing beneath the surface. Sound easy? Not exactly. Because first, you've got to figure out where to drill... There are 18 different sectors to explore and drill in, each with its own unique geography - and rules. Rove across the lifeless space station in your land vehicle, or soar above it all in a plane - if you can only find it. You'll be uncovering the secrets of a complex world where nothing is quite what it seems. And you'll need all the ingenuity you can muster to triumph!</Description>

		<Description>Bursting with high-speed arcade action, Emlyn Hughes International Soccer offers the most realistic gameplay ever seen on a home computer. You can almost sense the thrill of the crowd as the goalkeeper tips a dipping shot over the bar! Stand back, and for a moment you'll believe that you are watching a real match on TV!  Sophisticated artificial intelligence makes the play incredibly realistic, with diving headers and sliding tackles, even barging, side-stepping and backheels, plus free-kicks, throw-ins, goalkicks, corners and penalties! But that's not all - you can enter your own team of star players, set their skill levels individually, and manage them through the season. The fitness of each player is constantly changing, so you may have the difficult selection problems - do you take a risk and put your ace striker in the team if he isn't fully fit?</Description>

But wordly weapons will avail you naught, for your foe is the evil warlock who holds sway over the land. To defeat him you will have to match your skills as a necromancer against his, casting spells you have learned from your masters in the Circle of Enchanters and other incantations you will acquire as you proceed on your quest. If you succeed, you will be elevated to a seat in the illustrious Circle; if you fail, your land will be doomed to an eternity of darkness.</Description>

You get a vacation, and the ultimate vacation in this business is to become a goldfish. Yes, a goldfish. You swim a little, eat a little, live in a castle. Just as you were getting into the vacation mode, the tide turns. The most dangerous group of inter-dimensional anarchists surface - the Seven Deadly Fins.

For two wearisome years I experimented with my secrets of life force. Long hours spent in the laboratory tolling over bloddy tissue. Re-animating dead animal muscle: Notes, experiments, more notes, adjustments to my apparatus.
My experiments became an obsession! I forgot about food, my body became wasted. My eyes stared wildly from sunken sockets.
Friends had deserted me, considering me eccentric, I did not care! For I was destined to stand among the gods! Their equal, a creator... A giver of life itself!</Description>

As the dream unfolds, Garfield remembers that just around the other side of the Alps is Switzerland - which reminds him of chocolate! But snug in the chocolate fantasy he discovers the legendary "Chicken that Lays the Chocolate Eggs"... and from there the chase to catch the chicken is on! With Garfield skiing, skating and facing the trials of dealing with Odie, this is a unique blend of both arcade-style and adventure/puzzle-solving games.</Description>

		<Description>You're really up against it this time. These revolting robots have finally upped and turned their horribly powerful weapons on their kind human masters. Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand... I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out the mess? You guessed - you get the job. Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment and time is running out.</Description>

		<Description>There's a lot more to football than X's and O's. You haven't really experienced football until you've been down on the field, with an outside linebacker headed straight for you and nobody blocking him. There's a word for that experience - the word is pain. You haven't felt the real excitement of football until you've run the perfect pass pattern, broken free near the end zone, and caught the winning touchdown pass. There's a reward for that kind of performance - the reward is victory! You haven't seen real computer football until you've seen GFL Championship Football. It has what no other computer football program has: in-the-helmet perspective to put you down on the field, where the action is! Which is where you want to be if you're looking for real football. X's and O's were never like this!</Description>

		<Description>The time is yesteryear, when knights scoured the countryside in search of the Holy Grail, defended the honor of fair maidens and fought a never-ending battle against rampant evil forces. Thrown into this mayhem, is the courageous Sir Arthur. A victorious knight with the awesome task of penetrating the Demon's Castle to pulverize the Prince of Darkness. Can he do it? It's up to you. You'll dangerously travel through the Place of Execution, the Village of Decay, the Town of Fire, and the Crystal Forest with an arsenal of weapons at your side. And when you're really down on your luck, magic fights might with powerful results. The only problem? You'll have to learn how to use it. And avoid it. Because their magic has the power to change you into a helpless duck among other things. But there's not much time. Lives depend on you. So brandish your sword and make mincemeat of your foes.</Description>

		<Description>The residents of the once-peaceful city of Yuria have lost the legendary Golden Axe - the very thing that had shielded them from evil for so long. It is now in the hands of the unscrupulous titan, Death-Adder. Tarik, the seasoned warrior whose skill with his giant sword is both praised and feared throughout the land, has come forth to try and wrest the Axe from the grasp of the black-hearted warlord. Help Tarik to battle the many types of bandits that Death-Adder has amassed to protect himself. Using the sword, and certain very special magical powers, guide Tarik through the gauntlet of bandits to Death-Adder's castle! He'll be waiting there for you, and he's terribly reluctant to give up the Golden Axe! Are you brave enough to bring back the Axe, and thus restore tranquility to Yuria, or will you wind up just another victim of the evil warlord?</Description>

		<Description>Formula One racing is recreated in detail in this simulation. You can drive a McLaren, Ferrari or Williams car, each with different qualities, around the real-life Formula One circuits including Monaco, Suzuka and the original Hockenheim circuit characterized by long straights. Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1.</Description>

Here the game is reimagined by its original author in the style of an early 1980s coin-op arcade machine.  Of course this is a Minotaur Project game, so we ignore the limitations of such old hardware, borrowing just the style but presenting a slick, modern shooter that is a joy to play on iOS.As can be relied on in a Llamasoft game the controls are excellent and the gameplay fun, satisfying and rewarding.Gridrunner is OpenFeint enabled and supports leaderboards and achievements on both OpenFeint and GameCenter.Get your blasting trousers on and get ready to enjoy some classic shooting fun re-energised for the modern era.Another great Minotaur Project release.</Description>

Now, if you were a fully paid-up member of the notorious Guild of Thieves, things would be different. Mind you, it's not easy. You might find yourself ditched on a remote jetty by the Guildmaster. You might find that the Guild expects you to ransack a well guarded mansion. To go grave robbing. Potholing. Or maybe - if they're really doubtful of your abilities - everything at once! No problem, really, in a country full of helpful natives and friendly wildlife. Trouble is, you're not in a country like that. You're in Kerovnia. If you've played The Pawn, you'll remember Kerovnia. Except that the place seems to have gone downhill since then. But you'll find that out for yourself soon enough. And just one final hint - don't try any funny stuff. The Guildmaster has seen it all before. So has the Gatekeeper. So has the... But why should we give you any hints?</Description>

		<Description>It's A.D. 2500 and mankind has penetrated the galaxy's fringes, establishing colonies of peace from Mercury to Pluto. Suddenly, the tranquility of the Milky Way erupts into a frothing fury as armadas of alien deathships swarm into our solar system like killer bees preying on an innocent bystander. No one is spared. Even beloved Mother Earth is stung. These vicious cosmic Visigoths are war starved Gyrusians. And, led by the immortal Genghis Khan (whom they recruited from Mongolia centuries ago), they're out to trash civilization. With our galactic fleet flattened, you're the lone space cowboy who escaped the Gyruss shroud of doom. Now you must scorch through the galaxy, freeing planets by zapping endless enemy attacks with Neo-Bomb-Blastic Cannons and Ultra-Lazonic Phasers. So prepare for the fight of your life. And don't flinch, or else the entire universe will get pulverized!</Description>

		<Description>No, you haven't been drafted. It's not that easy. It's nothing that safe. The country needs a big favoure. The CIA is counting on you to preserve Western Civilization. The Russians have in their possession a notebook known only as The Doomsday Papers. With it, they can bring the world to its knees.
Using your special investigative prowess, you must break into a place that is not exactly a tourist attraction. It's a maximum security complex located somewhere in Siberia. The good news is that you won't need a passport. The Bureau is lending you their satellite so you can get into the complex with your computer. They've even managed to infiltrate the building with a few droids called Mobile Remote Units (MRUs)
It seems easy enough, once you penetrate the security. Just move the MRUs from room to room. Locate the combinations to the safe. Find the safe. And remove the documents. But it's not that easy. In face, it's downright dangerous. There are video cameras and monitors to be avoided. Guard patrols. And something called... the annihilator. Plus, the only map is the one you've got to make while not being discovered by all of the above. That's why the government wants you. Your reputation got you into this mess. Your skill will have to get you out. There meter is running.</Description>

		<Description>The crack of blades. The crash of helmets and the duel of sticks. It's just you and your opponent in a ferocious two-minute battle across the rink. The action begins at the sound of the bell. You shoot to center ice: take the puck across the blue line, and then weave and rush to outrace your challenger to the goal. He grabs the elusive puck and then it's up to you to hook it back. Sticks fly, he takes a shot off the boards. The puck is yours again! Time is running out! You attempt the most powerful score in the game. Swing your stick back and -- slapshot! The goalie slips and looks in astonishment as the puck zips past him. It's your third goal! You've scored a Hat Trick!</Description>

The incorrigible Mr. Adams has written new material and designed problems especially for this interactive story. So grab a pint of bitter and a couple for the road and join Ford Prefect, Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin on a cosmic jaunt into the outer reaches where anything can - and does - happen.

It's tic-tac-toe with a twist - get your X's and O's by figuring out whether a "star" is giving a correct answer or making one up. And keep in mind that they don't always tell the truth! Consider the question, then agree or disagree with our electronic celebrities and the big bucks will be yours if you're right. Test your knowledge and intuition. Is the "star" in the center square giving you a straight answer? Is that ridiculous response really right? Only you can decide.

		<Description>Want to burn some rubber? Feel the need for speed? Then take on HOT ROD and race through 30 turbulent tracks, encountering the meanest conditions, such as rain, snowdrifts and ice - then tackle the challenge of murderous rock slides and slippery sand. Tight corners abound with moving police cars and construction crews to hinder your way, testing your driving skills and stamina to the end. Win the races and buy extra parts from the race track garage - bigger engines, snow tires, bumpers and wings - then it's back to the starting line for more hot action!</Description>

		<Description>Eddie Hawkins, a.k.a. The Hudson Hawk, is called the world's greatest cat burglar, but he's called it quits. Some others, though, aren't ready for the Hawk to retire. They blackmail him into stealing priceless works by Leonardo da Vinci from a heavily guarded auction house and from the Vatican itself! The job has Hawk dodging bullets and guard dogs, thwarting sophisticated security systems, dangling from rooftops and crawling through booby-trapped ventilation shafts. And if Hawk makes it out alive? Well maybe he can turn the tables on his blackmailers. Because they aren't just art collectors, they have a plot to rule the world! But if Hawk can break into their lair, he just might be able to steal the one object that can stop them. The Hudson Hawk? Saving the world? It's a dirty job, but hey, somebody's got to do it!</Description>

		<Description>It's the end of the 20th century. A worldwide economic recession wreaks havoc with the nation and the planet. The impending threat of anarchy has given rise to a secret vice organization called "Crime Ghost." Dangerously poised to take over the world with its diabolic strategy, "Crime Ghost" has infiltrated every country simultaneously. There is one President who has initiated a plan to wipe out the association, but now his home has been attacked and his daughter Elise abducted. A letter has arrived demanding that he resign his powerful position within a number of days, or else his beautiful Elise will be executed in a most unpleasant manner. The letter is signed "Faust," the notorious mastermind of Crime Ghost. The president knows to whom he must turn. He has summoned two men, Paul and Vince, the incredible Ikari Warriors. Now YOU become Paul and Vince! You must go to the enemy hideout, rescue the lovely Elise, fight Crime Ghost and destroy them all!</Description>

		<Description>Your mission, Agent 4125, is to foil a horrible plot. From an underground laboratory, Elvin, the scientist, is holding the world hostage under the threat of nuclear annihilation. You must penetrate his stronghold, avoid his human-seeking robots and find the pieces of the security code. Somersault over the robots or use a precious snooze code to deactivate them long enough to search each room. Use the Agency's computer to unscramble the passwords from the code pieces, or try to solve them yourself. You've got to reach Elvin's control center, but you'd better beware... this mission is stamped IMPOSSIBLE!</Description>

		<Description>You're sly, smooth. You're Devon Aire, cat burglar extraordinaire! And now you've been hired by the wealthy widow Crutchfield to find the family jewels hidden in her maze-like mansion. Crutchfield Manor is no ordinary home sweet home. There are surprises around every corner. Secret passageways, hidden doors... dead ends. Peculiar pets like mutant mice and killer canaries stalk the halls and lurk in dark corners. But you can concoct some ingenious schemes to uncover clues, solve puzzles and recover the jewels. You can stack books on candlesticks, climb to the top of a grandfather clock, move bookcases, slide paintings, balance on champagne glasses or billiard balls. In fact, you'll do just about anything to get the job done! Loaded with surprises, The Hidden Diamond Caper is addictive, puzzle-solving fun.</Description>

		<Description>Hackers beware! You're about to tee off on a course so challenging that it would've had history's greatest golfers trembling in their knickers. Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. And it has more doglegs than a kennel. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play. So get a grip on yourself. Then swing into action on a course as legendary as the man who designed it.</Description>

		<Description>Truth is stranger than fiction. Nastier too. The most horrendous murders ever to set alight the imagination of the public were not the inventions of a novelist or a film director. They took place in real life. In London. Almost exactly 100 years ago. This game - if game is the right word for it - uses the power of modern computer technology to create the atmosphere, the terror, of those dreadful months in 1888 when London was in the grip of the Ripper. Necessarily, the game contains scenes which will be disturbing and upsetting. Necessarily, the action takes place in an atmosphere of dread, anxiety and, at times, sheer nerve-shredding horror. If it did not it would not be truthful to the subject it deals with. If you are not fully prepared to undergo an experience which may at times be decidedly unpleasant, please do not buy this software package.</Description>

Cannons, tanks, submarines and snipers will blast you with horrific crossfire, while jet fighters zero in from above. To defend yourself, you control the army's advanced all-terrain attack jeep, with its arsenal of guided missiles and incendiary grenades. Of course these are merely tools, and to save your countrymen you'll need more than a handful of gunpowder. You'll need a pocketful of miracles, and the ferocity of a wild Jackal!</Description>

		<Description>Just when a man thinks his luck is running out, things start getting even worse. He gets run over by a bus. Sprayed with cheese sandwich by a supernatural being. Smashed against a tunnel by a speeding train. He gets incinerated, widdled on, folded, bent, spindled, mutilated and generally mucked about with. And in return? He gets the leading role in a perplexing, hilarious race against time and chance, set in a jinxed land menaced by the impending death of good fortune. Look on the bright side - it could be your luckiest move yet. Don't expect tiresome trolls, obvious orcs, silly spells and wet, wimpish witches in JINXTER. Infuriating, enchanting, absurd and hilarious by turns, JINXTER will surprise you with every move you make. But don't forget: every silver lining has a cloud.</Description>

		<Description>John Elway's QUARTERBACK is the home video game you've been waiting for. So real you can see the game like a quarterback does, from the line of scrimmage. You call the plays, you throw the passes, run the ball, and make the tackles. It's third down and a long four long yards to the first down that will stop the clock. No time-outs left. The weak side linebacker is lined up inside his defensive end. They're coming! You check-off the play at the line of scrimmage and call for a quick pass to the tight end. He breaks it for a T.D.! Named for the quarterback who twice won the AFC Player of the Year Award, this is the game made for every kid who ever wanted to play the game as well as John Elway!</Description>

		<Description>Depending on your skill, confidence and courage, you have the choice of remaining near the landing pad, learning to hover and land, or venturing higher to practice your approaches. When you think you have mastered these, then accelerate the Jump Jet into an attack fighter. Use the radar and range finder to seek and destroy the enemy by launching heat-seeking, air-to-air missiles. Beware! His radar and missile systems are as good as yours. Reckless pursuit is ill-advised; you must maintain a fuel level that will enable you to relocate and return to the aircraft carrier, executing the skills you have learned to achieve a successful landing.</Description>

		<Description>You know what it's all about. That's right. The crazy cop and his almost crazy partner are back to do the city a world of good. As Martin Riggs or Rogar Murtaugh, you've got a lot to decide - like how you're gonna outwit and outdo the major outlaws of L.A. It doesn't get rougher or tougher than the streets of Los Angeles, where you'll take on drug smugglers, terrorists, The Organization and a hostage situation at a shopping mall. Which of these four mission will you tackle first? One thing's for sure, they'll all be tricky ...and deadly. How much of your life and your future are you willing to risk? As Riggs? As Murtaugh? Choose the best man for each mission. Remember, you'll need muscle and wits, so choose wisely. If you're sharp enough and quick enough, you may have time to catch your breath before you begin your final task for the Internal Affairs Department. This time, you'll be tracking down a corrupt police offier; one who knows how you move! So get moving...and do it carefully!</Description>

		<Description>Little people have been living inside computers for years, playing tricks on computer owners, but remaining hidden from view. Now they have been tempted into the open... This box contains a "house on a disc": load the disc onto your computer and the on-screen house will attract a little computer person from the depths of your computer, and he will make it his permanent residence. Then the responsibility begins - your new friend needs to be kept happy, well fed and watered. Ignore his physical needs and your new pal gets miserable, fades away, and might even die... Pander to his needs and he will play you records, write you letters, even beat you at cards!  Build up a relationship with your Little Computer Person, and you'll find it increasingly difficult to turn the computer off and wave him goodbye.</Description>

		<Description>A little bit of history with a little bit of mystery as you relive the nightmarish trek of Stanley in his search for the long lost missionary, Dr. Livingstone. But no African jungle was ever as forbidding as the treacherous journey that lies in wait for you. Poison darts from the pygmies, blood-spattering pit hammers in the diamond mines, spear-throwing natives in the bush... even the white men are hostile and would rather see you dead than alive. It's spine-chilling action every step of the way with a little adventure thrown in for good measure - hidden gems, secret temples?</Description>

		<Description>It couldn't be simpler. You get pieces of different sizes and shapes. One by one you put them down on the playing board - soon you've made your first loop. Yeaaaah! Now it's not so easy. This time you didn't get the pieces you wanted. Never mind - just start another loop. All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life). Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A). Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about LOOPZ. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record. Will LOOPZ drive you crazy? You bet!</Description>

		<Description>Mike Singleton's '84 classic Adventure Strategy game, brought to and updated for iOS."The Lords of Midnight is not simply an adventure game nor simply a war game. It was really a new type that became known as an epic game, for as you play the Lords of Midnight you will be writing a new chapter in the history of the peoples of the Free.You will guide individual characters across the land of Midnight on vital quests but you will also command armies that must endeavour to hold back the foul hordes of Doomdark, the witch king. Yours will be no inevitable victory." - Mike Singleton 1984"Lords of Midnight does story-based, large-scope, high-fantasy warfare better than most titles I can think of, iOS or otherwise." - Rating 4/5- PocketTactics.com"This is an outstanding remake and developer Chris Wild, should feel very proud of creating such a superb celebration of the man’s work." - Rating 8/10 - Metro"#1 - Top 5 iPhone and iPad games of the week"- AppMyWorld.com"If you're interested in classic games, especially fantasy and/or strategy games, Lords of Midnight is a must-have." -  Rating 4/5 - TouchArcade.com"App of the Year!"  - Rating 5/5, Mirror.co.uk"It's an unmissable remake.

		<Description>Ever since you arrived at G.U.E. Tech, you've heard stories about the creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some so ancient that they contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable junk. Until now, you've never ventured lower than the ground floors of the monolithic classroom and dorm buildings, avoiding the warren of tunnels that connect them.
But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths of the institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside, making the outdoors as threatening as anything you could imagine within. Perhaps it's the nightmare you had, hinting at horrific mysteries below and leaving you with a strange object that seems to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps it's just another way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper you have due tomorrow.
In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your computer and into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly, you're in a world that rivals your most hideos visions, a realm of horror lurking beneath the calm corridors and study halls.
Shapes emerge from dark corners. Eerie sounds draw closer. Slimy passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will feed your nightmares for weeks.
THE LURKING HORROR recalls the ghastly visions of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world into a frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will challenge both first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's chilling descriptions will leave you with images you'll never forget.</Description>

		<Description>It's you against yourself. And the clock. Easy enough. Except for the barrage of barriers that stand between you and the finish line. And, oh yes, little inconveniences such as rats the size of cars eager to leave a sharp impression on you. Don't let that stop you. After all, the measure of true success is the amount of obstacles one must overcome. Like hurdles that bring to mind skyscrapers. And big barrels, as in rolling right at your legs. And potholes. Jump on a skateboard and speed over the green slime tiles. Ever wonder what it would feel like to get shot out of a cannon? There're springboards along the course that'll shoot you through mid-air like a surface-to-air missile. Save your breath. There are 24 levels in all and each gets harder and harder as you go along. Metrocross - the fastest, most challenging, most cockamamie course ever conceived by man or beast.</Description>

		<Description>It's 1031. The world is on the brink of chaos. In the United States of North America, spiraling crime and unemployment rates, decayed school systems and massive government regulations have led to a lazy, contentious society.
To reverse this critical situation, government and industry leaders have developed a Plan combining the economic freedom and strong moral values of the 1950's with the technological advancements of the 21st century. Will the Plan ensure peace and prosperity? Or will it set the earth on a suicide course to destruction?
As the world's first conscious, intelligent computer, only you can visit places that have never been seen before. Only you can view the future. And only you know what must be done to save humanity. A major departure for Infocom, A Mind Forever Voyaging is reminiscent of such classic works of science fiction as Brave New World and 1984. You'll spend less time solving puzzles, as you explore realistic worlds of the future.</Description>

		<Description>More ghosts haunt the misty seacoast and stone ramparts of Cornwall than anyplace else on earth. One such soul roams Tresyllian Castle: a pale phantom with flaxen hair and a luminous, flowing gown. It seems like a fanciful legend... until the spectral "White Lady" threatens the life of your friend Tamara!
Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of eccentric characters ranging from a blue-blood debutante to an overly helpful butler. Has one of them donned the ghostly guise of the White Lady? Or has the drowned lover of Lord Jack, Tamara's fiancé, returned to haunt her successor? Perhaps the spectre is seeking the valuable treasure hidden somewhere in the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the castle. The solution to the mystery, as well as the location of the treasure, changes in each of the four variations of MOONMIST.</Description>

You first must qualify in the Desert Scramble where you race across the desert avoiding the prickly cactus, desert creatures, rocks, etc., in a race of speed and time. Hit an object and your dirt bike slows down. Hit too many and you won't qualify for the next race. The Hill Climb is a torturous race up a switchback mountain full of obstacles. Speed is important but control is vital or you'll be out of the race. Qualify with a fast time and you're in the Beach Sprint against other qualifiers in an all-out dash for the championship.</Description>

To release the elusive Flame Spirit, pluck 1,000 diamonds from the cavern walls as you descend deeper and deeper into the abyss. Its eerie music and ghostly flashes lure you. Grab it and race to the Temple! At last--you're inside! Seize the crown and speed to the mountaintop before the rampaging Cave Bats steal back your treasure!

		<Description>Infiltrate the criminal underworld - your mission is to seek out and destroy the kingpin of the MR. BIG CORPORATION - if you get that far. You'll have to outwit his enormous army of bodyguards, gangs of charisma-bypass patients in trench coats, the bullet brain with the build of a rhinoceros and the breath of a dung beetle, packs of vicious canine yappies, the psychotic clown with an evil sense of humor - you'll die, but not laughing! The there's the gas-guzzling cadillac jock - a cool specimen, elbow hanging on the door rail, a serious looking piece in his hand and ready to blow you away as he rolls down main street leaving you coughing blood. It's not all bad! You've got a chopper to back you up, a mean, shiny street machine, some heavy metal hardware and some pretty neat moves. And what about the kingpin... did I say he was Mr. Big? No, he's MR. BIG!</Description>

		<Description>The head honcho over at Destructo Inc. headquarters has sent you to this alien-forsaken planet, Nebulus, to do what you do best. Destroy stuff. Like towers taller than the Empire State Building. What the bonehead also neglected to tell you is that there are 8 of these monuments hidden in the middle of a toxic ocean. And that to get rid of them, you've gotta work your way to the top of them. Plus one more itty bitty detail: The more towers you topple, the tougher the next one gets!</Description>

		<Description>Elm Street... where dreams are blurred with reality... where all dreams become nightmares... the street where Freddy lives.
You must go there. You alone have the power to save your friends and stop Freddy.
You sleep, and let the nightmare consume you, carrying you into the endless night of Freddy's world. Once there,  you move quickly, driven by something between fear and determination, expecting strange horrors to lunge at you every step of the way.
It is real? No, it's the game of your life! It's A Nightmare on Elm Street... like the movie, but more terrifying because this time Freddy is after you!
It's a game of smarts, chances, dares and scares. And it all takes place in Freddy's world--a House of Horrors full of tunnels, mazes, spirals... with puzzles to master, weapons to choose from and unending dangers to conquer. And Freddy is in his finest hour... laughing, taunting, attacking... and cheating! You'll face surprises in every corner and impending doom with every step.</Description>

In the meantime, your spies are looking for the incendiary... Oil Imperium shows you how tough business can be. Dirty tricks, the kind you'd normally only see on TV, are part of your everyday agenda. But besides your instincts for money and intrigue, you also require skill for the action sequences where you must search for oil, set up pipelines or try to extinguish fires.</Description>

		<Description>Brace yourself for the most realistic racing experience yet. And to play, you've got to have what it takes: NERVE, SKILL and BRAINS. NERVE - you're behind the wheel of a supertuned race car with one speed only: fast. SKILL - you're maneuvering a car that can nearly reach a simulated 270 KMH. BRAINS - because you're in control of your car's speed and handling at a dangerous pace, you have to use your head and not just your hands to survive. So get geared for the ride of your life and stay alert. The track may look terrific, but at these speeds anything can turn into a danger zone.</Description>

		<Description>Radiation from the sun caused terrible damage to the environment and forced people to retreat underground, safe from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. Vast subterranean cities evolved, but in isolation. Today, the only link between these underground cities is the old network of surface freeways now ruled by anarchic gangs of outcasts, known wholly as surface dwellers. The only people daring to make trips these days are the Overlanders. They are a breed apart. They keep themselves to themselves. Their only passion in life is their customized cars; pre-apocalypse vehicles dragged underground and rebuilt; rebuilt for speed and survival! They make journeys for cash, running cargo across the surface dwellers gauntlet. Life is improving the car, cargo's are carried for cash, cash means a better, faster, more powerful car...</Description>

Your search helicopter spots the Soviet-built Nanuchka missile corvette charging across the "Line of Death." You're foilborne and closing in at 50 knots. Guns blazing, you lock on and launch a Harpoon-guided missile. Through the waterspouts of his near misses, you see him explode in flames. Another mission accomplished!</Description>

		<Description>Set in the mythical world of Kerovnia, this amusing and complex tale is subtle enough to appeal to the beginner and hardened adventurer alike. A revolutionary text-handling system allows input of complicated sentences and complete interaction with characters (including some very intelligent animals!). The Pawn represents all its characters and objects as if they existed in a real world, storing complex information about their attributes and properties linked to their particular position or context in the game. Your objectives are manyfold: The simplest is to escape from Kerovnia, but you will find others as you wander about the land and communicate with the characters you meet. The Pawn combines a rich text adventure with stunning color graphics and a language parser that will set the standards for years to come!</Description>

		<Description>Dateline: January 8, 1992. The Persian Gulf. On the largest oil rig ever built, on top of the largest oil field yet discovered, a fanatical terrorist death squad holds the fate of western civilization in a clenched fist. Unless their demands are met by midnight, the terrorists will detonate a captured U.S. nuclear warhead. The Persian Gulf will beocme an enormous radioactive fireball and the United Nations officials held hostage will die. The world community, unwilling to negotiate with terrorists, has been left with only one option - a suicide mission against impossible odds. You are the only volunteer.</Description>

		<Description>A multiple-character role playing game, PHANTASIE transports you to the medieval Isle of Gelnor for the adventure of your dreams. You command a group of one to six characters with such roles as monk, priest, wizard, ranger, thief or fighter. Your companions need not be human: they may be gnomes, elves, orcs or lizard men - just to name a few of the exotic races. With this motley crew, you search the lands for the Nine Rings to help you wipe out the scourge of Gelnor - the Dark Lord and his evil minions. You'll map out new terrain, explore maze-like dungeons, solve puzzles, learn spells, gain experience and battle countless monsters. In every town you visit you can recruit new members to replace lost or unneeded comrades. Beautiful Hi-Res color graphics and a spellbinding storyline suspend reality and launch you into our magical world. No computer-carrying adventurer will want to miss out on the glorious excitement and enchanting experience that is PHANTASIE!</Description>

		<Description>Your quest to remove the evil warlock's curse will be no easy task since there are precious few clues. All you know is that locating the orb requires a danger-filled search of a vast wilderness and of dungeons, a trip to the Astral Plane and the Netherworld - wherever they are. You command a band of one to six adventurers, each endowed with the skills of a monk, priest, wizard, ranger, thief or fighter. During this quest you'll help your heroes gather treasure, solve puzzles, learn spells, and battle the Dark Lord's countless hordes. With all these magical distractions and obstructions, don't forget that finding the orb will do you no good. You'll still have to find a way to destroy it!</Description>

So fast, the enemy has only minutes to react. So deadly, there is no second chance. The need for speed... Your search helicopter spots the Soviet-built Nanuchka missile corvette charging across the "Line of Death." You're foilborne and closing in at 50 knots. Guns blazing, you lock on and launch a Harpoon-guided missile. Through the waterspouts of his near misses, you see him explode in flames. Another mission accomplished!</Description>

		<Description>Pipe Mania is a classic puzzle arcade game that is so addictive to play, that once you start, you just cannot put it down - it should come with a government health warning! Pipe Mania is a game of great ingenuity, very simple in concept but fiendishly challenging to play. The object of the game is to assemble sections of pipe, as quickly as possible, before the slime catches up with you. The game has three playing modes and a training mode, so it caters for the absolute beginner right up to the accomplished expert. You will need to act instinctively, but think strategically! One wrong move, one brief hesitation or misplaced pipe section, and you will drown in a sea of slime! Good luck!</Description>

Too rested, I said. I was ready for action. He asked if I'd heard tales of the legendary lost caverns of Machu Picchu in Peru. Or of a roaring, uncharted underground tributary of the Urubamba River replete with waterfalls and deadly electric eels. "Yes," I said. He asked if I knew of the infamous, cursed Raj Diamond. Or of the recent robbery of gold bars from the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. And had I heard of vampire bats? Poisonous frogs? Albino scorpions? The dreaded Andean condor? "Yes," I said. And could I still run? Climb? Jump? Could I... swim? "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes." "Good," said Crane. "Then you'll do it?" "Of course," I said. If only I had known...</Description>

		<Description>Let me introduce myself. I'm Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting's my game, and yours, too, if you're daring enough to take this trip with me. Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</Description>

		<Description>In the 17th century, the seas are as wild as the untamed heart of a young woman. But when you set out on the schooner Lafond Deux, bound for the West Indies, your thoughts are only of your ailing father who awaits your care. Little do you know that you innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous adventure.
You barely survive an encounter with pirates, whose plans for you include a fate worse than death. The explosives, the rocky reefs, the vicious crocodile-all these are obstacles which you must overcome with cunning and agility. True, it's not easy; but at least you can control your fate. What you cannot control is much more dangerous: your passion for Nicholas Jamison, the handsome pirate captain.
Tall and lean, with azure eyes that penetrate deep into your soul, he makes your blood quicken despite his unsavory past. When you're in his arms, swirling around the dance floor or secluded in the flowered depths of the gazebo, you are apt to forget your mission.
But don't dally too long with Nick. For your father is waiting, and on his rescue lies the fate of more than one man. Prepare for adventure on the high seas, lass. You'll need every bit of pluck you can muster.
In PLUNDERED HEARTS, Infocom brings your wildest fantasies to life. You'll thrill to spine-tingling peril, heart-pounding romance, and challenging predicaments. To create this exotic adventure, author Amy Briggs read hundreds of romance novels, researched 17th century costumes and ships, and was wooed by a dashing pirate.</Description>

		<Description>A sadistic crime wave is sweeping through Old Detroit. The situation is explosive - in fact, it is so bad a private corporation, O.C.P., has assumed control of the police force. Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named ROBOCOP! As ROBOCOP you are programmed to 1) Serve the public trust, 2) Uphold the law, and 3) Protect the innocent as you blast your way through city streets. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including ROBOCOP's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see ROBOCOP eliminated. Make your way past street thugs, the notorious Clarence Boddiker and the powerful Ed-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play! It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of Old Detroit - it's going to take ROBOCOP!</Description>

It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum.

A buncha slimy, horrible, totally gross and putrid monsters are taking over the bodies of the people who live here and they wanna build a weapon that's gonna take over the entire planet! Pretty cool, huh? Anyway, yours truly is the only one who can see 'em 'cause of my X-ray glasses - so it's up to me to stop 'em! I've gotta spraypaint things, get radical on my skateboard, use my trusty slingshot, and in general behave like a nuisance, man.

So if you're a decent person, a patriot, and somebody who cares about this sorry planet, you'll do the right thing. Save the Earth! BUY THIS GAME! Thanks, man!</Description>

Fortunately, our sleepwalker has a courageous canine companion who will try his utmost to protect his master from coming to any harm - Lee's faithful mutt, Ralph. Lee's 4-legged friend is zapped, bashed, clobbered, pummeled, singed and squashed, but nothing will stop him from performing his dedicated duty... it's all par for the course of a night errand. These midnight meanderings take him to the most hazardous of places... the creepy graveyard, the gooky zoo, precarious construction sites and the traffic strewn city streets, but Lee's loyal rover steadfastly guards his master from all impending dangers - with painful consequences!</Description>

		<Description>He's back! Slightly returns in an authentic remake of the original classic arcade adventure.

Bigwiz the wizard has left the castle in a hurry, in order to turn the Kings son Newton back into a frog. Indeed, he was in such a hurry that he forgot to pack his spare wand, forgot to lock his laboratory door, and most importantly, forgot to return his utterly stupid, idiotic, incompetent, brain-dead nephew Slightly to his parents mud hut in the hills.

Oh well, it could be worse. A sunburnt dragon could be running off with the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak. The wizards spell cabinet might have been knocked over by a Flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering the spells everywhere. His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind panic, have given Slightly the wizards private spell book to read. It might rain.

You see, it could be worse. But as it is, theres not a cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragons breath to be sniffed. Hang on, wheres that pink fire-breathing creature going with that screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or is it something stronger?

Oh no. Get the washing in mother, and lock all doors. Cancel the papers, and shoot the cow. I think its going to be one of those days</Description>

Under attack and besieged by countless monstrous beings, Fantasyland is fighting a losing battle. But wait, help is on the way! The heroic Space Harrier has jettisoned into their time warp via intergalactic teleportation. Armed with the same laser blaster that made Space Harrier victorious in the Land of the Dragons, you've got a host of vicious enemies to destroy. Space phantoms, multi-headed reptiles and wicked wizards are just a few of the targets to set your sights on. And they're everywhere. So keep your eyes on 'em, shoot straight, and keep moving. One false move and it's the end for you and Fantasyland!</Description>

		<Description>You're the only soul in a twilight zone that's like nowhere you've ever been before. It's a space station in the middle of nowhere... an eerie world full of deadly surprises... a time bomb of explosive vapors. And your mission is to find out what makes it tick and avert impending disaster before it's too late. All you've got to do is drill and release the volatile vapors brewing beneath the surface. Sound easy? Not exactly. Because first, you've got to figure out where to drill... There are 18 different sectors to explore and drill in, each with its own unique geography - and rules. Rove across the lifeless space station in your land vehicle, or soar above it all in a plane - if you can only find it. You'll be uncovering the secrets of a complex world where nothing is quite what it seems. And you'll need all the ingenuity you can muster to triumph!</Description>

		<Description>Stand by, Strider. Upon receiving your orders from the commander, you are dropped into the heart of Russia, armed with only your lightning-quick sword. Your task is to infiltrate the Red Army and return enemy secrets to your superiors. Your mission begins in Red Square, but after fighting off KGB attacks there, your clues lead you to the snow-capped mountains of Siberia to battle both the elements and the enemy. If you survive this icy test, your orders are to proceed south to the Lowlands where jungle tribes wait with spears and poison arrows. Now you must return to Moscow to face the Grand Master of the Red Army. It is vital that you get to him before he destroys you or the world will fall under Russian control. The free world relies on your success!</Description>

		<Description>Strike Force Harrier puts you in the cockpit for a full flight and combat simulation of one of Britain's most exciting fighter aircraft. Your objective is to bomb the enemy HQ, at the same time defending yourself and your ground sites from enemy aircraft and ground forces. You have cannon, bombs, and Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles at your disposal - but the enemy is just as well-armed as you are. You can select either practice or combat level, with a skill level of pilot, commander or ace. At the end of each mission your score is given, calculated on the basis of your distance from the enemy HQ.</Description>

		<Description>Open the throttle fully and 'pull g'. Your turbo-charged V8 engine hugs banked curves before climbing up and away off a ramp hundreds of feet above the ground. Glide past your opponent in mid-air before crashing back onto the track, your chassis shuddering and tires squealing. No time to look back - the next bend looms and you're still not in full control! As a Stunt Car Racer, you're blasting around eight roller-coaster tracks at over 200 miles an hour, pitting your wits and high speed driving skills against computer controlled opponents or a friend via a datalink cable, all in amazingly fast, smooth 3D graphics. If you survive to become Division One champion, you're in the Superleague with a machine twice as powerful. Stop your car breaking up under the strain and then accelerate still further. There are no prizes for second place in this game - It's all or nothing!</Description>

		<Description>Sure Summer Games was great, but why stop there? Summer Games II will take you even farther with eight challenging, new events. You and up to seven other contestants can compete in your favorite individual event or go for it all in teh grand competition. Some events, like cycling, rowing and fencing even challenge you with realistic head-to-head competition.
First, decide which of the 18 different countries you're going to represent. Then, in true Olympic fashion, you will need the proper strategy and mental toughness, not just speed and agility to excel in each of the eight events. That's why we included a feature that lets you practice each event until you're ready for the real competition.
Remember, it's not too early to get ready for 1988. With the right diet, proper training and lots of practice you just might make it. In the meantime, put on your sweatsuit, grab that joystick and let Summer Games II give you eight new ways to Go For The Gold!</Description>

		<Description>In 2050 the first wave of colonists left Earth for the nearby solar system of Tau Ceti, as the first wave of man's greatest adventure. On the inhospitable desert world of Tau Ceti III, a new life began. In 90 years thirty great cities were built, until without warning a great plague decimated the new world. The remaining desperate colonists were evacuated and in time a cure was found. An expedition force was dispatched and then destroyed by the now-malfunctioning defense systems. The only way to incapacitate the automatic defenders was to shut down the massive fusion reactor that fueled the planet. It was decided that a single highly skilled pilot in an armed ground skimmer might succeed where 50 would surely fall. Like a fool, you volunteered.</Description>

		<Description>The Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles are out to rescue lovely April O'Neil, who's been captured by Shredder - a maniac more menacing than an army of mind-altered Bruce Lees. But if they're to succeed, you must command the role of each turtle, rumbling through 6 New York territories patrolled by Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly Foot Clan. Along the way you'll encounter Mouser infested sewers, criminally polluted rivers, and villainous streets run by the terrorist team of Rocksteady and Bebop. So grab your nunchukus and prepare to put yourself in someone else's shell. Because in this to-the-death adventure, you'll control every leap, chop, slice and dice, until you knock heads with Shredder and either splatter him senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup.</Description>

		<Description>It comes from the future. It can take any shape and survive almost any injury (even when a 10-gauge shotgun blast opens it up like a tin can). Its mission: eliminate John Connor. Its name: the T-1000. Against it stands one hope: you, a terminator model T-800... equipped with on-screen target search displays, a lever-action Winchester, and 10 barrels of high explosives... one mean machine. Protect John Connor (before a 23,000 lb. tow-rig plows your Harley into tomorrow). Save humanity (while Uzi-armed SWAT teams try to blow you away). Terminate the T-1000 (steel mill metldown!)... or mankind is history.</Description>

It's a good thing that he has Thomas and his friends to rely upon. You control Thomas as he tries to complete all his tasks before the week is over.

		<Description>Prepare for fierce aerial combat with aircraft that span the years since the dawn of aviation. Your timeship's first encounter is with ancient 1910 biplanes; you're outnumbered, but your weapons are superior. Eliminate the entire air fleet; then knock out a mighty zeppelin and you'll progress to the next stage: 1940 monoplanes. These World War II fighters present a tougher challenge, and if you can defeat them, you'll move on to 1970 helicopters. Down the choppers and warp ahead to meet 1983 super jets. If you find a way to beat them, you'll cross the final barrier and head into the future for a deep-space duel with deadly flying saucers from the year 2001!</Description>

		<Description>TOOBIN' IS TOTALLY TUBULAR!


Wanna be a real party animal? Then, you just gotta play Toobin'! It's the most fun anyone can have on an inner tube!

You and a buddy can take turns paddling down a prehistoric swamp, jostling with dinosaurs and cavemen.

Or cruise down some modern city river where you'll try to evade nasty punks and slimy industrial sludge (ugh, real barfo!)

If that isn't far-out enough, then float down some Martian canals - where the water's purple and everything's really out of this world!

These are just examples, dudes. Toobin's got so many places to tube around, it'll blow your mind.

So jump in, the water's totally rad and bad!</Description>

High above hostile waters your mission is to defend the task force from enemy attack. Suddenly, bogeys flash onto your radar. They're everywhere, diving toward you at Mach 2. Only a second to react, you go to guns and arm missiles. Your heart pounds and palms sweat as you blast into the dogfight with cannons blazing. Tracers zip past your engines. Shells shatter your senses. Now it's just you against them. And to survive you'll need more than speed and firepower. You'll need guts and instinct. You'll need to be a "TOP GUN" pilot!</Description>

And the high jump. No timeouts, no breathers, no water boys. Just you and your own exhaustion. So get psyched. Pick your level of competition and the opening event. Then block out the roar of the crowd and take a deep breath. Because it's not whether you win or lose. It's whether you survive!</Description>

		<Description>Upon escaping the crumbling ruins of Shadowguard, the black fortress of Minax, you lay your weary body on the now-sacred ground. As you rest, you remember your first encounter with the evil wizard of Mondain, whom you later tracked down and destroyed. The existence of his apprentice, Minax, was soon revealed and the crusade was begun again. Younger and more cunning than her mentor, she has been much more difficult to vanquish. But now your sense of accomplishment is touched by a chilling fear. Have all vestiges of evil been removed? Somehow, you sense that your treacherous foes have not been eliminated. Without further feats of skill, daring and perseverance, all of your past accomplishments may be lost. You stand up, prepare your armor, and walk to the dimension door. Stepping in, the hunt resumes.</Description>

		<Description>Prepare yourself for a grand adventure: Ultima IV, sixteen times larger than Ultima III, is a milestone in computer gaming. Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>

Your friends and neighbors lived in peace. Until the Rogue gang got too big for their britches. You chilled, hoping things wouldn't get too rough. No such luck. They've taken your girlfriend Maria, and there's only one thing you can do... get her back... anyway you can! You have fists of steel! Legs like pistons! And courage that just won't quit! You will need all three because the Rogues are waiting with knives, guns and a whole bunch of nasty punks. And you'll have to fight fast. If the Rogues make it back to their headquarters before you rescue Maria, all hope will be lost. But catch them first and you'll fight the leader of the Rogues. Win Maria... and your turf... will remain safe. Feel any pressure? No way. You're the Vigilante!</Description>

Power up your tank with special features such as enhanced speed, shot range, shot power, force field or even "Smart Shots." Keep replenishing your tank's fuel supply. Once you're out of gas, you're out! Destroy all the enemy stations and you'll face the evil Emperor of the alien empire in a final showdown. Win and the world cheers with you.

		<Description>The whole of J.R.R. Tolkien's panoramic vision has been included in this epic game. Follow in the footsteps of Frodo, Aaragorn and Gandalf as they battle to get the ring to the Cracks of Doom. Ranged against you are all the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron and the corrupt wizard Saruman. The odds are overwhelming, but you cannot aford to fail. The destiny of Middle Earth lies in the balance. Multiple playing levels let you control all the characters and armies that appear in "The Lord of the Rings" from the broad sweep of strategy, right down to individual characters' actions on the battlefield. There are infinite possibilities so no two games will ever be the same. Gripping action means you will always want another game. Guard carefully and travel well, my friend. May the fellowship of the ring be successful, and peace return to all Middle Earth.</Description>

		<Description>CIVILIZATION'S LAST STAND!


Mutants. Again. Even more than there were last time: they seem to materialize out of the very grains of the radioactive desert sand. Venomous yellow eyes. The black gunmetal glint of Uzis as they close in for the kill. There's nowhere to run, and nothing to rely on but your MAC 17 machine gun. What a way to save the human race.


MORE REAL THAN YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE!

* Roam the deserts of the American Southwest. Neon lights never made Las Vegas glow like this.

* All your actions are permanent. If you blow up the library, don't expect to check out books later.

* No swords, no spells. Pistols, rockets, submachine guns, laser weapons, and cunning are all the magic you need.


STRATEGY IS EVERYTHING!

* A whole new dimension in tactical combat. 

* Plan your attack. Split up your party at any time and put your specialists to work.

* Burn the whole clip. Fire in shot bursts. Or do the job with just one shot. How lucky do you feel?


EXPLOSIVE STORYLINE!

* Your characters gain real knowledge. Pick locks. Fire rockets. Disarm bombs. Decode messages. Learn survival skills that weren't in the Boy Scout manual.

* A cast of hundreds. Everyone wants to meet you --- most of them in the worst possible way.

* Plenty of subplots, intricate puzzles, and graphic surprises await in the vast nightmare of a post-nuclear world. 


LOTS OF EXTRAS!

* Top-down views like Deathlord, close-up characters like The Bard's Tale.

* Extra booklet details encounters with strange desert inhabitants.

* From the creators of The Bard's Tale series.</Description>

		<Description>This is the computer game that everyone is talking about - or soon will be - in excited whispers and bewildered exclamations. It's the game with the soccer ball that devours knife-wielding little girls... then burps. The one with totem pole heads hopping on kangaroo bodies under skies full of fish. The one with a giant killer bee that wants your cotton candy, the grandfather clock that paints the way, and the lawn mower that grinds you to a bloody pulp. Like the famous ink blot test, the bizarre scenes, puzzles and arcade-style challenges in Weird Dreams will mean different things to different people. Some will think them uproariously funny. Others will find them strange and unsettling. Still others will be outright offended. Decide for yourself. One thing is certain: there has never been a computer game like Weird Dreams. You have to play it to believe it.</Description>

		<Description>A game that takes fantasy role playing one step further. You will experience all the action as you do real battle with your opponents.

		<Description>Are you ready to step into the world of Wizardry? Unmatched by any other fantasy role-playing game, the Wizardry Gaming System allows for unlimited combinations of strategies and tactics, so that each quest into the Maze is always fresh and interesting.

Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first Wizardry scenario. Starting in the Castle, you assemble one to six adventurers to explore the magic and mystery of the ten-level 3-D Maze. Your characters may be one of five races and eight professions, each with strengths and weaknesses.

Under your command, brawny warriors, frail magis, pious clerics, and nimble thieves accumulate experience and treasure. As your characters gain experience, they develop greater capabilities to become even better adventurers, allowing them to venture deeper into the Maze.

Be wary! The treacherous Maze has some tricks and traps of its own. Hundreds of monsters, many with magical powers equal to your own; pits; chutes; rotating rooms; teleporters; special one-of-a-kind surprises; and much more will keep you on your toes for many hours of fun. May luck and good fortune be your companions!</Description>

		<Description>World Championship Soccer kicks-off against an international set of stars for the prized World Championship. To win, you'll move swiftly through qualifying rounds onto the Final Tournament where only the best are lined up for intense competition.


Maybe you'll meet the teams of France, Italy or England who play with the unusual bravado. Long on strategy, they prove worthy contenders against the fiery speed of their Latin counterparts from Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. But nothing beats the determination of China and Japan whose team credo remains, "Never say die!". And these are just some of the twenty-four teams, our ol' red, white and blue included, who are ready to kick, dribble and shoot their way to victory.


So how will you play? Tough offense, strong defense? Only one can win. So lace up your cleats and let's see some smoke on that field.</Description>

		<Description>Just a normal 2 year supply run to the mining installation on Sirius B, until the cargo pod decided to remain in hyperspace, wrenching part of the coupling away, sending a destructive charge of energy through the ship. It took 3 days to arrive at the ESSEN mining station. On the landing pad, the situation looks sinister. There is no sign of life! The facts are, you must repair the ship, obtain fuel and provisions and reprogram the ship's computer. With a bit of luck, the mining colony should have all the necessary spares. But what fate befell the 200 workers stationed here? What stalks the metal labyrinths below the surface? What mystery links the horror within - to the dawn of human civilization? Can you survive a descent into the lair of the Xenomorphs?</Description>

As the only other Federation ship in the sector, you had to go to his aid. You need to fight your way through 16 zones, collecting essential supplies for the fleet. At the end of each sector you have a chance to refuel and restock but only after you have defeated the most vicious alien you have ever seen!

		<Description>For a bear that's smarter than the average, life in Jellystone Park should be one long picnic. After all, everyone knows picnics mean picnic baskets! But life has taken a nasty turn. Poor little lovable Boo Boo has been "bearnapped" by a bloodthirsty hunter and is a prisoner somewhere in the Park! Heroic as ever, Yogi is on Boo Boo's trail. But Jellystone's a big place and you'll have to find plenty of tasty snacks to keep our trusty bear's strength up. Especially since along the way Yogi's pursued by angry campers, a furious Ranger, ferocious animals and homicidal hunters! Time's getting short too. Yogi's hibernation season is nearly here. So you'll need speed and a lot of bare (ouch!) cunning to rescue Boo Boo before Yogi slumps into his slumbers.</Description>
