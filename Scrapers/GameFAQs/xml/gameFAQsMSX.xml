		<Description>Become Genghis Khan and lead the most fearsome army in the known world. Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</Description>

		<Description>You are Marty McFly, just a typical senior at Hill Valley High. But after getting behind the wheel of a nuclear-powered sports car turned time machine, you find yourself in the year 1955 where you've accidentally tampered with history. Now it must be corrected. You must somehow make sure that teenagers Lorraine Baines and George McFly (the two kids that will eventually grow up to become your parents) fall in love before the photo of your family fades away and you're left with nothing to come home to. It won't be easy. You'll have to protect George from Biff and his gang of bullies while doing your best to keep them from beating you up instead. To complicate things, Lorraine has a crush on you, so you'll have to dodge her advances while trying to figure out a way to get George and her to kiss at the school dance. Time is wasting and even if you manage to put all of the pieces in place, there is still no guarantee that you'll get back. It will all come down to one brief moment in time when the past, present and future all meet.</Description>

		<Description>It has been more than 40 years since the first nuclear bomb exploded. In that time, the shape of the world has changed dramatically. The power to destroy civilization rests in the hands of the superpowers and now, as either the President of the U.S. or as the General Secretary of the U.S.S.R., you have total responsibility for your nation's course. To succeed, you must enhance your country's prestige without infringing too much on your adversary's interests. If you play the isolationist, you will find yourself alone in a world dominated by your opponent. If you are too aggressive, you could unleash the war that annihilates humankind - and both sides lose. Balance of Power uses a huge statistical database, a meticulously detailed display of the world, and advanced artificial intelligence techniques to put you in command of one of the world's superpowers. You have vast amounts of information available as you press your country's interest and resist the pressure of the other side. Noted game designer Chris Crawford has created a model of the world which will entertain, educate, challenge and perhaps frighten you in ways no computer game has done before.</Description>

The giant in his eye is not just sheer cheek, it's from the golden keys that he has to collect - but don't be too dazzled by the thought of amassed riches - round every corner in every passage danger lies in wait.</Description>

		<Description>On a dull day in the Middle Ages, you overhear Town Elders discussing a sinister presence which has invaded the castle on the outskirts of town. Evil talismans hidden inside a castle have caused the dead to come back to life. If the spirits are not released quickly, they will mass into an army of the Undead and overtake the town! Creeping through the graveyard on your way to the castle, half-chewed arms and skulls with gnashing teeth attempt to stop you. Diabolical scenes greet you. Ever hear how a person sounds when in an iron maiden? But then you did say you wanted adventure, didn't you?</Description>

Chubby's one passion is FOOD and on this heaven-on-earth mission nothing will stop him as he bounces his way through screen after screen of grub; munching his way to the ultimate one-ton mark.

		<Description>Drift back to ancient Phoenicia and challenge yourself with Columns, a game favored by middle eastern merchants. In this mesmerizing pastime, tinker with your riches to align glittering jewels across, down, or diagonally. As you line up colors, the gems vanish and more sparklers drop from above. The challenge increases as the jewels fall more rapidly. You must quickly align them before the columns reach the top. Imagine yourself on the warm Mediterranean coast, or drifting over a languid sea. Forget the passage of time, and tickle your mind with Columns, the brilliant game of strategy and skill.</Description>

		<Description>The big screen classic, in which modern day vigilante Paul Kersey wreaks his own form of revenge on the scum and filth that terrorize the streets of modern day New York. For too long the gangs have run wild, unchallenged in their merciless attacks and violations of innocent citizens. Muggings and robberies have become a daily feature of city life. So when the chief of police turns a blind eye you decide to take over where the law left off. Strap on your famous 475 WILDEY MAGNUM. Turn yourself into a one-man fighting force armed with pump-action shotgun, machine gun and rocket launcher. Now turn the tables on the punks and creeps who certainly know how to dish out the violence but may not be so good at being on the receiving end.</Description>

		<Description>You're really up against it this time. These revolting robots have finally upped and turned their horribly powerful weapons on their kind human masters. Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand... I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out the mess? You guessed - you get the job. Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment and time is running out.</Description>

		<Description>Become Genghis Khan and lead the most fearsome army in the known world. Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</Description>

		<Description>The greatest athletes from around the world have gathered for the grandest sporting spectacle since the golden age of Greece. This pressure-packed competition is as fierce as a starved lion. Surviving is a matter of sweat and concentration in Taekwondo, pole vaulting, canoeing, skeet shooting, hammer throwing, high diving, archery, hurdles, gymnastics, hang gliding, pistol firing, arm wrestling, fencing, triple jumping and swimming... Whew! Wears you out just to read them all. The odds in Vegas say you don't have enough strength, stamina or skill, but you know better. And as long as you win, you're the crowd favorite.

		<Description>Hackers beware! You're about to tee off on a course so challenging that it would've had history's greatest golfers trembling in their knickers. Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. And it has more doglegs than a kennel. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play. So get a grip on yourself. Then swing into action on a course as legendary as the man who designed it.</Description>

		<Description>Depending on your skill, confidence and courage, you have the choice of remaining near the landing pad, learning to hover and land, or venturing higher to practice your approaches. When you think you have mastered these, then accelerate the Jump Jet into an attack fighter. Use the radar and range finder to seek and destroy the enemy by launching heat-seeking, air-to-air missiles. Beware! His radar and missile systems are as good as yours. Reckless pursuit is ill-advised; you must maintain a fuel level that will enable you to relocate and return to the aircraft carrier, executing the skills you have learned to achieve a successful landing.</Description>

		<Description>For one or two players, KLAX makes you move fast - and think faster! Catch colored tiles coming down a conveyor belt. Score big points by arranging them in same-colored stacks of threes - vertically, horizontally or diagonally. A tic-tac-tile game if you will. Sounds easy? It is... until the tiles come tumbling at you so fast, you'll go nuts trying to catch them all - while figuring out where best to stack them before you run out of room! No matter how tough it gets, the hardest part is pulling yourself away from this fun, fast, and totally addictive game!</Description>

		<Description>A little bit of history with a little bit of mystery as you relive the nightmarish trek of Stanley in his search for the long lost missionary, Dr. Livingstone. But no African jungle was ever as forbidding as the treacherous journey that lies in wait for you. Poison darts from the pygmies, blood-spattering pit hammers in the diamond mines, spear-throwing natives in the bush... even the white men are hostile and would rather see you dead than alive. It's spine-chilling action every step of the way with a little adventure thrown in for good measure - hidden gems, secret temples?</Description>

		<Description>What would you think if your best friend went on a date with the King of the Dark World - because she thought he was cute?! You'd think she'd been duped - and you'd be right. The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! Yuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one - and you will control her. She is to become the greatest warrior in the universe, never suspecting that her most fearsome battle will not be  against a Dark Lord, but against her closest friend from the Human World - the one she warned, "Don't go out with him, he's the Dark..." But before she could finish, her friend ran off into The Darkness.</Description>

		<Description>The greatest athletes from around the world have gathered for the grandest sporting spectacle since the golden age of Greece. This pressure-packed competition is as fierce as a starved lion. Surviving is a matter of sweat and concentration in Taekwondo, pole vaulting, canoeing, skeet shooting, hammer throwing, high diving, archery, hurdles, gymnastics, hang gliding, pistol firing, arm wrestling, fencing, triple jumping and swimming... Whew! Wears you out just to read them all. The odds in Vegas say you don't have enough strength, stamina or skill, but you know better. And as long as you win, you're the crowd favorite. But lose, and you might as well turn in your jockstrap and joystick.</Description>

		<Description>This story begins long ago. The evil Emperor Penguin happened to meet one of his subjects, Lucytesse, of matchless beauty, and he fell madly in love with her. His love was unrequited, though. She only had eyes for her beloved Pentaro, a young good-looking penguin from the neighborhood. They were a happy couple, but the Emperor, in a fit of rage and jealousy, kidnapped Lucytesse, and carried her off to his palace at the South Pole. Pentaro departed swiftly to rescue her and, after countless perils and adventures in the ice and crevices of the South Pole, finally succeeded in reaching the Emperor's palace and rescuing his sweetheart!</Description>

		<Description>Your quest to remove the evil warlock's curse will be no easy task since there are precious few clues. All you know is that locating the orb requires a danger-filled search of a vast wilderness and of dungeons, a trip to the Astral Plane and the Netherworld - wherever they are. You command a band of one to six adventurers, each endowed with the skills of a monk, priest, wizard, ranger, thief or fighter. During this quest you'll help your heroes gather treasure, solve puzzles, learn spells, and battle the Dark Lord's countless hordes. With all these magical distractions and obstructions, don't forget that finding the orb will do you no good. You'll still have to find a way to destroy it!</Description>

		<Description>Let me introduce myself. I'm Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting's my game, and yours, too, if you're daring enough to take this trip with me. Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</Description>

		<Description>Warning! QUARTH is the blockbuster puzzle challenge guaranteed to knock your socks and your block off at a maddening, mind-numbing pace. With a mortifying rain of bionic block patterns descending upon you, you race back and forth in your powerful Blockbuster ship obliterating the blocks before they blow you to kingdom come. Your incentive to stay alive is the points you rake in for every block you wipe out. And if you chalk up enough points to qualify, you'll charge into bonus games where it's you against the clock and the unstoppable blocks of QUARTH. So, ace, if you think you've got the steady hands of a brain surgeon, the sharp eye of an eagle, and the steely nerves of a Hollywood stuntman, power up QUARTH. And see if you can outlast the blockbusting action!</Description>

		<Description>You're a helicopter gunship pilot on a daring and dangerous mission: air surveillance of enemy territory. Success depends on how far you can penetrate enemy airspace. Can you handle the pressure? Because the further you go, the more difficult the mission becomes. Show that you've got what it takes by maneuvering your chopper around craggy mountain peaks, through deep dark tunnels, and over tall city buildings. All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!</Description>

Your timeship's first encounter is with ancient 1910 biplanes; you're outnumbered, but your weapons are superior. Eliminate the entire air fleet; then knock out a mighty zeppelin and you'll progress to the next stage: 1940 monoplanes. These World War II fighters present a tougher challenge, and if you can defeat them, you'll move on to 1970 helicopters. Down the choppers and warp ahead to meet 1983 super jets. If you find a way to beat them, you'll cross the final barrier and head into the future for a deep-space duel with deadly flying saucers from the year 2001!</Description>

		<Description>The greatest athletes from around the world have gathered for the grandest sporting spectacle since the golden age of Greece. This pressure-packed competition is as fierce as a starved lion.

Whew! Wears you out just to read them all. The odds in Vegas say you don't have enough strength, stamina or skill, but you know better. And as long as you win, you're the crowd favorite.

Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>

		<Description>On the baddest streets of the city they know your name. You are lean and mean... the karate master they call the Vigilante! Your turf was left alone. Your friends and neighbors lived in peace. Until the Rogue gang got too big for their britches. You chilled, hoping things wouldn't get too rough. No such luck. They've taken your girlfriend Maria, and there's only one thing you can do... get her back... anyway you can! You have fists of steel! Legs like pistons! And courage that just won't quit! You will need all three because the Rogues are waiting with knives, guns and a whole bunch of nasty punks. And you'll have to fight fast. If the Rogues make it back to their headquarters before you rescue Maria, all hope will be lost. But catch them first and you'll fight the leader of the Rogues. Win Maria... and your turf... will remain safe. Feel any pressure? No way. You're the Vigilante!</Description>

		<Description>The whole of J.R.R. Tolkien's panoramic vision has been included in this epic game. Follow in the footsteps of Frodo, Aaragorn and Gandalf as they battle to get the ring to the Cracks of Doom. Ranged against you are all the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron and the corrupt wizard Saruman. The odds are overwhelming, but you cannot aford to fail. The destiny of Middle Earth lies in the balance. Multiple playing levels let you control all the characters and armies that appear in "The Lord of the Rings" from the broad sweep of strategy, right down to individual characters' actions on the battlefield. There are infinite possibilities so no two games will ever be the same. Gripping action means you will always want another game. Guard carefully and travel well, my friend. May the fellowship of the ring be successful, and peace return to all Middle Earth.</Description>

		<Description>Are you ready to step into the world of Wizardry? Unmatched by any other fantasy role-playing game, the Wizardry Gaming System allows for unlimited combinations of strategies and tactics, so that each quest into the Maze is always fresh and interesting.
Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first Wizardry scenario. Starting in the Castle, you assemble one to six adventurers to explore the magic and mystery of the ten-level 3-D Maze. Your characters may be one of five races and eight professions, each with strengths and weaknesses.
Under your command, brawny warriors, frail magis, pious clerics, and nimble thieves accumulate experience and treasure. As your characters gain experience, they develop greater capabilities to become even better adventurers, allowing them to venture deeper into the Maze.
Be wary! The treacherous Maze has some tricks and traps of its own. Hundreds of monsters, many with magical powers equal to your own; pits; chutes; rotating rooms; teleporters; special one-of-a-kind surprises; and much more will keep you on your toes for many hours of fun. May luck and good fortune be your companions!</Description>
