		<Description>Let me introduce myself. I'm Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting's my game, and yours, too, if you're daring enough to take this trip with me. Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</Description>

But keep your eyeballs peeled... you won't always be travelling on "happy trails". Since these critters don't all gallop at the same speed, it takes a real cowpuncher to keep 'em herded. And, it takes a lot of fancy ropin' to go with the ridin'. Saddle up - and hang on to your hat! Stampede is the fastest fun this side of the Pecos!</Description>

All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!</Description>
