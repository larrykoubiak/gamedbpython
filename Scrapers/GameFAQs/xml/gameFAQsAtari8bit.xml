		<Description>You have no time to lose! An evil wizard has transformed you into a fragile ball with a tiny hole that is gradually leaking precious air. Trapped in a huge mansion of over 150 rooms, you must watch out for hidden dangers that threaten to puncture your delicate skin while you desperately seek rooms which contain airpumps to replenish your dwindling supply. But pay close attention to your pressure gauge - as long as you remain on the pump your internal pressure will continue to rise and will cause you to explode if you don't break away in time! It's a race against time and your only hope is to find the evil wizard's spellbook which contains the secret to regaining your human form. Can you outwit the wizard before he deflates your existence?</Description>

		<Description>There's a board. There are pieces with varying powers, squares to move into and an opponent to conquer. But the squares keep changing. And once you decide where to attack, the board explodes into a battlefield. Your pieces include phoenixes, golems and wizards, and they use all their strange powers when they fight the banshees, goblins and sorceresses they face. They cast spells and missiles, they pummel, pierce and throw out flames, they move each other around, take on each other's shapes and shriek at each other. If you square off on a spot that stays favorable, you'll be hard to kill. If you're smart, fast, dextrous and farsighted, you may win. If you're not, look for another game.</Description>

		<Description>The year is 3097... You are the contestant in the fastest, most competitive, and by far the most popular sport in the universe. You and your opponent are strapped into Rotofoils, hovercraft-like vehicles that skim the surface of the playfield at speeds of up to 50 meters a second. Your objective is simple - score the most points during the timed competition and be declared the champion. Your task, however, is a bit more complex. At the speed you're traveling, firing the Plasmorb through your opponent's goal takes more than just skill and timing. Do you want to take an Over-the-Horizon Shot worth 3 points or get within sight of the goal for a 2-point attempt? Your safest bet is to push it through, but this takes up precious time and is only worth 1 point. Think fast, because this is a 2-player game and your opponent is making the same decisions... or is he?</Description>

		<Description>Why buy this game when you could steal it? Except you can't. Not yet. An amateur like you? Come off it! Now, if you were a fully paid-up member of the notorious Guild of Thieves, things would be different. Mind you, it's not easy. You might find yourself ditched on a remote jetty by the Guildmaster. You might find that the Guild expects you to ransack a well guarded mansion. To go grave robbing. Potholing. Or maybe - if they're really doubtful of your abilities - everything at once! No problem, really, in a country full of helpful natives and friendly wildlife. Trouble is, you're not in a country like that. You're in Kerovnia. If you've played The Pawn, you'll remember Kerovnia. Except that the place seems to have gone downhill since then. But you'll find that out for yourself soon enough. And just one final hint - don't try any funny stuff. The Guildmaster has seen it all before. So has the Gatekeeper. So has the... But why should we give you any hints?</Description>

		<Description>It's A.D. 2500 and mankind has penetrated the galaxy's fringes, establishing colonies of peace from Mercury to Pluto. Suddenly, the tranquility of the Milky Way erupts into a frothing fury as armadas of alien deathships swarm into our solar system like killer bees preying on an innocent bystander. No one is spared. Even beloved Mother Earth is stung. These vicious cosmic Visigoths are war starved Gyrusians. And, led by the immortal Genghis Khan (whom they recruited from Mongolia centuries ago), they're out to trash civilization. With our galactic fleet flattened, you're the lone space cowboy who escaped the Gyruss shroud of doom. Now you must scorch through the galaxy, freeing planets by zapping endless enemy attacks with Neo-Bomb-Blastic Cannons and Ultra-Lazonic Phasers. So prepare for the fight of your life. And don't flinch, or else the entire universe will get pulverized!</Description>

		<Description>Ever since you arrived at G.U.E. Tech, you've heard stories about the creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some so ancient that they contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable junk. Until now, you've never ventured lower than the ground floors of the monolithic classroom and dorm buildings, avoiding the warren of tunnels that connect them.

But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths of the institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside, making the outdoors as threatening as anything you could imagine within. Perhaps it's the nightmare you had, hinting at horrific mysteries below and leaving you with a strange object that seems to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps it's just another way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper you have due tomorrow.

In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your computer and into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly, you're in a world that rivals your most hideos visions, a realm of horror lurking beneath the calm corridors and study halls.

Shapes emerge from dark corners. Eerie sounds draw closer. Slimy passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will feed your nightmares for weeks.

THE LURKING HORROR recalls the ghastly visions of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world into a frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will challenge both first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's chilling descriptions will leave you with images you'll never forget.</Description>

One such soul roams Tresyllian Castle: a pale phantom with flaxen hair and a luminous, flowing gown. It seems like a fanciful legend... until the spectral "White Lady" threatens the life of your friend Tamara!

Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of eccentric characters ranging from a blue-blood debutante to an overly helpful butler. Has one of them donned the ghostly guise of the White Lady? Or has the drowned lover of Lord Jack, Tamara's fiancé, returned to haunt her successor? Perhaps the spectre is seeking the valuable treasure hidden somewhere in the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the castle. The solution to the mystery, as well as the location of the treasure, changes in each of the four variations of MOONMIST.</Description>

		<Description>Set in the mythical world of Kerovnia, this amusing and complex tale is subtle enough to appeal to the beginner and hardened adventurer alike. A revolutionary text-handling system allows input of complicated sentences and complete interaction with characters (including some very intelligent animals!). The Pawn represents all its characters and objects as if they existed in a real world, storing complex information about their attributes and properties linked to their particular position or context in the game. Your objectives are manyfold: The simplest is to escape from Kerovnia, but you will find others as you wander about the land and communicate with the characters you meet. The Pawn combines a rich text adventure with stunning color graphics and a language parser that will set the standards for years to come!</Description>

		<Description>In the 17th century, the seas are as wild as the untamed heart of a young woman. But when you set out on the schooner Lafond Deux, bound for the West Indies, your thoughts are only of your ailing father who awaits your care. Little do you know that you innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous adventure.

You barely survive an encounter with pirates, whose plans for you include a fate worse than death. The explosives, the rocky reefs, the vicious crocodile-all these are obstacles which you must overcome with cunning and agility. True, it's not easy; but at least you can control your fate. What you cannot control is much more dangerous: your passion for Nicholas Jamison, the handsome pirate captain.

Tall and lean, with azure eyes that penetrate deep into your soul, he makes your blood quicken despite his unsavory past. When you're in his arms, swirling around the dance floor or secluded in the flowered depths of the gazebo, you are apt to forget your mission.

But don't dally too long with Nick. For your father is waiting, and on his rescue lies the fate of more than one man. Prepare for adventure on the high seas, lass. You'll need every bit of pluck you can muster.

In PLUNDERED HEARTS, Infocom brings your wildest fantasies to life. You'll thrill to spine-tingling peril, heart-pounding romance, and challenging predicaments. To create this exotic adventure, author Amy Briggs read hundreds of romance novels, researched 17th century costumes and ships, and was wooed by a dashing pirate.</Description>

From the second you take command, you'll live by the motto FIND 'EM, CHASE 'EM, SINK 'EM, as you follow instruments, charts and your instincts in search of hostile convoys. Every decision you make will tempt fate, whether you risk a nighttime surface attack with deck guns blazing, or fire your last torpedo at a troop transport escorted by sub-killing destroyers. Your only relaxing moments away from the depth charges will come during torpedo and gunnery practice off the bomb ripped coast of Midway Island. So batten down your mental hatches. And remember, only 2 inches of steel and your tactical genius come between you and a watery grave!</Description>

Can you handle the pressure? Because the further you go, the more difficult the mission becomes. Show that you've got what it takes by maneuvering your chopper around craggy mountain peaks, through deep dark tunnels, and over tall city buildings. All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!</Description>

		<Description>Upon escaping the crumbling ruins of Shadowguard, the black fortress of Minax, you lay your weary body on the now-sacred ground. As you rest, you remember your first encounter with the evil wizard of Mondain, whom you later tracked down and destroyed. The existence of his apprentice, Minax, was soon revealed and the crusade was begun again. Younger and more cunning than her mentor, she has been much more difficult to vanquish. But now your sense of accomplishment is touched by a chilling fear. Have all vestiges of evil been removed? Somehow, you sense that your treacherous foes have not been eliminated. Without further feats of skill, daring and perseverance, all of your past accomplishments may be lost. You stand up, prepare your armor, and walk to the dimension door. Stepping in, the hunt resumes.</Description>

Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>
