		<Description>Deep in the heart of a mysterious mountain lies a rare-golden crown enshrined within an ancient Temple. Guarded by the ominous Skull Spirit, only those who possess the power of the Flame Spirit may gain entrance.
To release the elusive Flame Spirit, pluck 1,000 diamonds from the cavern walls as you descend deeper and deeper into the abyss. Its eerie music and ghostly flashes lure you. Grab it and race to the Temple! At last--you're inside! Seize the crown and speed to the mountaintop before the rampaging Cave Bats steal back your treasure!
Simple, right? Wait. Cave Bats can also steal back the Flame Spirit. And lurking within the depths of the mountain is a Giant Sprider waiting to trap you in its web.
Armed with only a flashlight and a thirst for adventure, you'll need nerves of granite to become Mountain King. C'mon--you're going down under!</Description>

Or of a roaring, uncharted underground tributary of the Urubamba River replete with waterfalls and deadly electric eels. "Yes," I said. He asked if I knew of the infamous, cursed Raj Diamond. Or of the recent robbery of gold bars from the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. And had I heard of vampire bats? Poisonous frogs? Albino scorpions? The dreaded Andean condor? "Yes," I said. And could I still run? Climb? Jump? Could I... swim? "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes." "Good," said Crane. "Then you'll do it?" "Of course," I said. If only I had known...</Description>

		<Description>You're a helicopter gunship pilot on a daring and dangerous mission: air surveillance of enemy territory. Success depends on how far you can penetrate enemy airspace. Can you handle the pressure? Because the further you go, the more difficult the mission becomes. Show that you've got what it takes by maneuvering your chopper around craggy mountain peaks, through deep dark tunnels, and over tall city buildings. All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!</Description>
