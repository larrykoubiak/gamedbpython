		<Description>A challenging space game, Conflict 2500 is a radical departure from the typical first generation one-ship startrek-type games. In Conflict 2500, you have the option to set the scenarios, ranging from one-on-one competition against the computer to elaborate situations involving up to 10 people. The computer will play smart, acting out a variety of strategic actions to countermand your actions and strategy. Conflict 2500's variable scenario system gives you the option of playing a quick game (20 minutes) or a long multi-ship game (2 or more hours), allowing you to set the game up as easy or as difficult to master as desired.</Description>
