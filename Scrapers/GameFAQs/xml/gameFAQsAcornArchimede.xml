		<Description>You can design a car, house, aeroplane (or whatever you want!) and then walk around it. See what it looks like from any angle. Change it. Add color, detail, animation. The possibilities are endless. And it's ideal for creating games. If you're not artistic, don't worry - there are lots of objects already included in the kit for you to use in your plans, but it's simple to create your own if you want. So, if you enjoy playing games, but want to use your computer's real capabilities for a change, this is a perfect opportunity.</Description>

		<Description>A suspicious suicide. A chilling curse. A malevolent power. And a wicked dark secret. This is Derceto, legendary Louisiana mansion - where, against your better judgement, you're drawn into a world of shadows to explore the darker side of Jeremy Hartwood's imagination. Despite a paralyzing sense of personal danger, your quest for truth drives you to investigate the old house. But, you didn't know that by entering Derceto, you'd be plunged into the daily nightmare that was Jeremy Hartwood's life. You weren't prepared for the torturous howls that resound from deep within its halls. You didn't foresee the shadowy corridors that seemingly have no end. You couldn't anticipate the brooding, gloom-filled rooms, the pervasive weight of dread, the heavy sense of evil that fills the atmosphere and teh very house itself. Had you known, you might have refused your task. But alas, you accepted, and now you must make your way through this spine-tingling adventure alone... and in the dark.</Description>

		<Description>Sometime during the last century, an experimenter with time, space and early computers created a bizarre machine. The inventor's name was Baron Fortesque. The machine was... The Chaos Engine. Although primitive, the machine became incredibly powerful and went crazy, turning ordinary humans and household pets into razor-toothed, armor-plated killing machines. Enter 6 hard-nailed mercenaries for hire. These ball-breakers are armed to the teeth with over 25 weapons and a host of special destructive devices specific to their class. Select 2 characters to form your party and enter the World of Chaos. The sprawling adventure covers 4 graphic worlds and 16 levels loaded with fiendish traps, puzzles and secret passages. Get your hands on sawn-off shotguns, molotov cocktails and a huge amount of armament, and buy, blag or blast your way through hordes of different monsters to do battle with the ultimate killing machine, THE CHAOS ENGINE!</Description>

		<Description>Welcome to Descent™ - 30 levels of the most mind-bending, stomach-churning action game ever. Featuring true 3-Dimensional worlds with light source shading, texture mapping, 3-D morphing, directional sound effects and sizzling music, this is technology taken to the limit.
You begin deep below the surface of Lunar Base I where on unknown alien race has taken over the chasm of the Post-Terran Mining Corporation. Lunge straight down mine shafts, twist around never-ending tunnels and fight your way past robotic menaces in an environment that's truly 360° 3-D... move up, move down shoot everything everywhere. Hang onto your senses (and your lunch) as you drop straight down mine shafts on a ride that'll leave you spinning.
And what's the good of losing your mind if you can't share the experience with your friends? Descent invites you and your buddies to dive into the action together with head-to-head combat and cooperative two-player modem and eight-player network support.</Description>

		<Description>Just when a man thinks his luck is running out, things start getting even worse. He gets run over by a bus. Sprayed with cheese sandwich by a supernatural being. Smashed against a tunnel by a speeding train. He gets incinerated, widdled on, folded, bent, spindled, mutilated and generally mucked about with. And in return? He gets the leading role in a perplexing, hilarious race against time and chance, set in a jinxed land menaced by the impending death of good fortune. Look on the bright side - it could be your luckiest move yet. Don't expect tiresome trolls, obvious orcs, silly spells and wet, wimpish witches in JINXTER. Infuriating, enchanting, absurd and hilarious by turns, JINXTER will surprise you with every move you make. But don't forget: every silver lining has a cloud.</Description>

		<Description>Set in the mythical world of Kerovnia, this amusing and complex tale is subtle enough to appeal to the beginner and hardened adventurer alike. A revolutionary text-handling system allows input of complicated sentences and complete interaction with characters (including some very intelligent animals!). The Pawn represents all its characters and objects as if they existed in a real world, storing complex information about their attributes and properties linked to their particular position or context in the game. Your objectives are manyfold: The simplest is to escape from Kerovnia, but you will find others as you wander about the land and communicate with the characters you meet. The Pawn combines a rich text adventure with stunning color graphics and a language parser that will set the standards for years to come!</Description>
