		<Description>Due to the meddlings of Professor Chronos and his time machine, the very reality of the universe is threatened. He has brought back a number of artifacts from different periods of history and stored them in his time lab. During one of these temporal shopping sprees, the time machine exploded, scattering its component parts throughout the centuries. Because of this, the universe has now started to rotate about its fifth axis, making the present less probable with each passing moment. Someone needs to return all the artifacts and recover the time machine before everything literally ceases to exist. That someone is you.</Description>

		<Description>Destruction is the name of the game as two mighty monsters pulverize buildings, torch attacking insects and flying reptiles, search for food - not to mention the occasional native - to restore your strength as you battle to reach the fiery volcano and your chance to grab the golden egg. Bulldoze your way through the 12 cities of the Lost Island in a quest for the Golden Dragon's Egg. With head-to-head battles against your only rival in the mean monster stakes along the way, this is a real challenge. Fast all-action, hand-to-hand combat, huge colorful animated graphics, superb backdrops and ear-splitting stereo sound effects, all combine to make AAARGH an instant hit!</Description>

		<Description>Armageddon Man casts you as the Supreme Commander of a future barely balanced Earth. The Earth has been split into 16 separate nuclear capable countries, such as the Black African Republic, Japan and European Unite, and it's your job to make sure it doesn't become lifeless.

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</Description>

		<Description>You are Marty McFly, just a typical senior at Hill Valley High. But after getting behind the wheel of a nuclear-powered sports car turned time machine, you find yourself in the year 1955 where you've accidentally tampered with history. Now it must be corrected. You must somehow make sure that teenagers Lorraine Baines and George McFly (the two kids that will eventually grow up to become your parents) fall in love before the photo of your family fades away and you're left with nothing to come home to. It won't be easy. You'll have to protect George from Biff and his gang of bullies while doing your best to keep them from beating you up instead. To complicate things, Lorraine has a crush on you, so you'll have to dodge her advances while trying to figure out a way to get George and her to kiss at the school dance. Time is wasting and even if you manage to put all of the pieces in place, there is still no guarantee that you'll get back. It will all come down to one brief moment in time when the past, present and future all meet.</Description>

		<Description>The Penguin is back and he's set himself up as a respectable umbrella merchant. Or has he? Could the umbrella factory be just a cover for his plot to take over the world with an army of robotic penguins? As Batman you must match clues you've collected to locate the master computer and - POW! ZAP! CRUNCH! - put an end to the demented squawkings of that overweight birdbrain. But that's not all! As soon as you've taken care of the Penguin, the Joker pulls off his greatest feat of sleight of hand - he kidnaps Robin! At the scene of the crime you must gather all the facts. Then, while the trail is still hot, you're off on a crime-solving adventure. Grab your Batarang and rev up the Batmobile - because if you don't reach Robin in a hurry, the last laugh will be on you! HA! HA! HA! HA!</Description>

		<Description>For many years the ancient city of Irkon has been ruled over by the great and evil wizard VADRA. The inhabitants of IRKON have been suppressed and enslaved by this wizard and anyone who speaks out against him is instantly imprissions, or worse. You are one of these citizens having been imprisoned long ago. As weel as imprisoning you, as further punishment VADRA also turned you into an amorphous blob, without movement or form.
To help him keep control of the people of IRKON, VADRA forced the craftsmen to make vast bottles over which he cast an evil spell. The spell caused the bottle to ooze out large embryonic bubbles which burst leaving spellbound mutant creatures under the control of VADRA. When the people saw the first of these mighty bottles they called it: BUBBLER™®</Description>

		<Description>The race begins! Drive your race-tuned Baja Bug along the race track, passing through gates and collecting flags for points. Time gates give you an additional two seconds on the next leg so drive through them if you can. Collecting the flags in the specified order gives you extra points. Avoid hitting the fences, walls, trees and other obstacles as they'll flip your buggy over and slow you down. You are competing against the clock so don't waste time, push the pedal flat to the floor. Try jumping obstacles by hitting the logs that lie across the track. Show off your driving skills by running over molehills and tree stumps, tipping your car onto two wheels - see how long you can keep your buggy in this trick position. Now fasten your seatbelt for the ride of your life!</Description>

		<Description>The CK23 test development site is the most secret military complex on earth. Hidden somewhere on a mountainous and now deserted island, it is surrounded by deadly minefields, high voltage electric fences and surveillance cameras. The island itself is bristling with military activity, from armed foot patrols to roaming lethal tanks. It is your mission to explore the island and find the heart of the development complex. Once there you must steal the design of the CK23 and then set a time delay bomb in the nuclear reactor. The explosion which follows will devastate the entire island. The action takes place on a moonless night, hence you have been provided with a Sightless Image Enhancer (SIE) with head-up display. Using advanced 3D-vector graphics with full collision detection, you will see an accurate picture of your 'world' as you move within it. You will be able to see and explore entire villages. Around any corner could lurk an armed guard or tank ready to dispatch instant death. Being quick on the trigger is essential for survival. It is also possible to enter and explore buildings - which may contain vital information or boobytraps. The civilian workforce hid a network of 'spies'. Unfortunately they have all been evacuated but you must understand their incredible mission if you are to succeed. This alone will test your powers of reasoning and deduction to the full. Catch 23 is a vast game with one of the biggest challenges ever designed on a home microcomputer. It is the closest thing yet to actually being there.</Description>

		<Description>Championship Baseball has it all. You begin by drafting a team. Look over the talent pool. You'll need starting pitchers, relievers, infielders, outfielders, even utility players for bench strength. Consider each player's talents carefully before putting them on your team. Once you've selected your team, set your batting order. Then choose which of the four divisions suits you, and play ball! Championship Baseball gives you more options. You may want to start with some batting practice to master the fine art of hitting a screwball. Then, challenge a friend or the computer to 9 innings of intense action. When you're ready, pick your team and enter the 4-division, 24-team race for the pennant! You control all the action - pitching, hitting, catching, outfield relays, base running, even sliding under tags. All in the most realistic baseball simulation you can find!</Description>

		<Description>The big screen classic, in which modern day vigilante Paul Kersey wreaks his own form of revenge on the scum and filth that terrorize the streets of modern day New York. For too long the gangs have run wild, unchallenged in their merciless attacks and violations of innocent citizens. Muggings and robberies have become a daily feature of city life. So when the chief of police turns a blind eye you decide to take over where the law left off. Strap on your famous 475 WILDEY MAGNUM. Turn yourself into a one-man fighting force armed with pump-action shotgun, machine gun and rocket launcher. Now turn the tables on the punks and creeps who certainly know how to dish out the violence but may not be so good at being on the receiving end.</Description>

		<Description>Strategy is vital in this chivalrous charade, and smarts will protect your hide better than armor as you command the role of a brave Saxon knight destined to avenge King Richard's murder. To reclaim the crown and conquer the heart of a beautiful maiden, you must outwit and outmaneuver hordes of medieval marauders. Read maps, plan raids, even team with Robin Hood, then plunder enemy strongholds, dueling for gold needed to build an army of mercenary vassals. You'll also need to stash cash for catapults that launch boulders, fire and disease into formidable fortresses. So wise up and rise up to this unique challenge where leadership is as important as swordmanship. For when you've survived this strategic adventure, complete with daring jousts and courageous castle sieges, you won't be sorry - you'll be king!</Description>

		<Description>Bursting with high-speed arcade action, Emlyn Hughes International Soccer offers the most realistic gameplay ever seen on a home computer. You can almost sense the thrill of the crowd as the goalkeeper tips a dipping shot over the bar! Stand back, and for a moment you'll believe that you are watching a real match on TV!  Sophisticated artificial intelligence makes the play incredibly realistic, with diving headers and sliding tackles, even barging, side-stepping and backheels, plus free-kicks, throw-ins, goalkicks, corners and penalties! But that's not all - you can enter your own team of star players, set their skill levels individually, and manage them through the season. The fitness of each player is constantly changing, so you may have the difficult selection problems - do you take a risk and put your ace striker in the team if he isn't fully fit?</Description>

		<Description>In ENCHANTER, the first of a spellbinding series in the tradition of Zork, you are a novice magician whom fate has chosen to do singlehanded combat with a dark and fierce power. But wordly weapons will avail you naught, for your foe is the evil warlock who holds sway over the land. To defeat him you will have to match your skills as a necromancer against his, casting spells you have learned from your masters in the Circle of Enchanters and other incantations you will acquire as you proceed on your quest. If you succeed, you will be elevated to a seat in the illustrious Circle; if you fail, your land will be doomed to an eternity of darkness.</Description>

		<Description>Get ready for over 100 levels of pulsating action as you take on the powers of your favorite player, even if they're already in play. Watch out for the death curse of the evil "IT" and flee from the thieving grasp of the "THAT" creature. Stun Tiles, Acid Puddles, Force Fields, Super Sorcerers, Phony and Moving Exits make your progress all the more difficult. But there are mystical amulets to be collected which will enhance your powers to repel monsters, transport through walls or increase your firepower. Avoid poisoned food and potions, collecting them makes you dizzy!

		<Description>You're really up against it this time. These revolting robots have finally upped and turned their horribly powerful weapons on their kind human masters. Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand... I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out the mess? You guessed - you get the job. Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment and time is running out.</Description>

		<Description>Formula One racing is recreated in detail in this simulation. You can drive a McLaren, Ferrari or Williams car, each with different qualities, around the real-life Formula One circuits including Monaco, Suzuka and the original Hockenheim circuit characterized by long straights. Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1.</Description>

Now, if you were a fully paid-up member of the notorious Guild of Thieves, things would be different. Mind you, it's not easy. You might find yourself ditched on a remote jetty by the Guildmaster. You might find that the Guild expects you to ransack a well guarded mansion. To go grave robbing. Potholing. Or maybe - if they're really doubtful of your abilities - everything at once! No problem, really, in a country full of helpful natives and friendly wildlife. Trouble is, you're not in a country like that. You're in Kerovnia. If you've played The Pawn, you'll remember Kerovnia.

The good news is that you won't need a passport. The Bureau is lending you their satellite so you can get into the complex with your computer. They've even managed to infiltrate the building with a few droids called Mobile Remote Units (MRUs)
It seems easy enough, once you penetrate the security. Just move the MRUs from room to room. Locate the combinations to the safe. Find the safe. And remove the documents. But it's not that easy. In face, it's downright dangerous. There are video cameras and monitors to be avoided. Guard patrols. And something called... the annihilator. Plus, the only map is the one you've got to make while not being discovered by all of the above. That's why the government wants you. Your reputation got you into this mess. Your skill will have to get you out. There meter is running.</Description>

They blackmail him into stealing priceless works by Leonardo da Vinci from a heavily guarded auction house and from the Vatican itself! The job has Hawk dodging bullets and guard dogs, thwarting sophisticated security systems, dangling from rooftops and crawling through booby-trapped ventilation shafts. And if Hawk makes it out alive? Well maybe he can turn the tables on his blackmailers. Because they aren't just art collectors, they have a plot to rule the world! But if Hawk can break into their lair, he just might be able to steal the one object that can stop them. The Hudson Hawk? Saving the world? It's a dirty job, but hey, somebody's got to do it!</Description>

Standing in the shadow of the dark, dismal starship hovering silently above, we were completely unaware of the macabre fate that awaited us. No, the humans hadn't come in search of precious minerals. They had come for us. Radiation poisoning from a recent nuclear war has driven Earth's entire animal population into premature extinction, forcing the humans to scour new planets for livestock and laboratory specimens. Our fate is sealed, or is it? There is one last chance of survival. Hidden deep within the bowels of the planet lies an old escape pod.

You must penetrate his stronghold, avoid his human-seeking robots and find the pieces of the security code. Somersault over the robots or use a precious snooze code to deactivate them long enough to search each room. Use the Agency's computer to unscramble the passwords from the code pieces, or try to solve them yourself.

That's where you come in. As a 25th century sleuth, your mission is to find the secret code accessing the stronghold of ELVIN, that malicious mastermind bent on world domination. Uncover clues in the executive office suites without being zapped by lightning-shooting push-bots. Or maybe you'd rather search the parking garage where you'll have nasty mine layers to deal with. Each tower is wired with state-of-the-art surveillance cameras, robot guards, and secret security-encoded passageways. Impossible Mission II requires strategic moves and sharp investigative sense to outsmart Elvin and his band of destructive evil doers!</Description>

		<Description>Truth is stranger than fiction. Nastier too. The most horrendous murders ever to set alight the imagination of the public were not the inventions of a novelist or a film director. They took place in real life. In London. Almost exactly 100 years ago. This game - if game is the right word for it - uses the power of modern computer technology to create the atmosphere, the terror, of those dreadful months in 1888 when London was in the grip of the Ripper. Necessarily, the game contains scenes which will be disturbing and upsetting. Necessarily, the action takes place in an atmosphere of dread, anxiety and, at times, sheer nerve-shredding horror. If it did not it would not be truthful to the subject it deals with. If you are not fully prepared to undergo an experience which may at times be decidedly unpleasant, please do not buy this software package.</Description>

Smashed against a tunnel by a speeding train. He gets incinerated, widdled on, folded, bent, spindled, mutilated and generally mucked about with. And in return? He gets the leading role in a perplexing, hilarious race against time and chance, set in a jinxed land menaced by the impending death of good fortune. Look on the bright side - it could be your luckiest move yet. Don't expect tiresome trolls, obvious orcs, silly spells and wet, wimpish witches in JINXTER. Infuriating, enchanting, absurd and hilarious by turns, JINXTER will surprise you with every move you make. But don't forget: every silver lining has a cloud.</Description>

		<Description>Depending on your skill, confidence and courage, you have the choice of remaining near the landing pad, learning to hover and land, or venturing higher to practice your approaches. When you think you have mastered these, then accelerate the Jump Jet into an attack fighter. Use the radar and range finder to seek and destroy the enemy by launching heat-seeking, air-to-air missiles. Beware! His radar and missile systems are as good as yours. Reckless pursuit is ill-advised; you must maintain a fuel level that will enable you to relocate and return to the aircraft carrier, executing the skills you have learned to achieve a successful landing.</Description>

		<Description>A little bit of history with a little bit of mystery as you relive the nightmarish trek of Stanley in his search for the long lost missionary, Dr. Livingstone. But no African jungle was ever as forbidding as the treacherous journey that lies in wait for you. Poison darts from the pygmies, blood-spattering pit hammers in the diamond mines, spear-throwing natives in the bush... even the white men are hostile and would rather see you dead than alive. It's spine-chilling action every step of the way with a little adventure thrown in for good measure - hidden gems, secret temples?</Description>

		<Description>It couldn't be simpler. You get pieces of different sizes and shapes. One by one you put them down on the playing board - soon you've made your first loop. Yeaaaah! Now it's not so easy. This time you didn't get the pieces you wanted. Never mind - just start another loop. All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life). Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A). Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about LOOPZ. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record. Will LOOPZ drive you crazy? You bet!</Description>

		<Description>Ever since you arrived at G.U.E. Tech, you've heard stories about the creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some so ancient that they contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable junk. Until now, you've never ventured lower than the ground floors of the monolithic classroom and dorm buildings, avoiding the warren of tunnels that connect them.
But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths of the institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside, making the outdoors as threatening as anything you could imagine within. Perhaps it's the nightmare you had, hinting at horrific mysteries below and leaving you with a strange object that seems to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps it's just another way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper you have due tomorrow.
In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your computer and into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly, you're in a world that rivals your most hideos visions, a realm of horror lurking beneath the calm corridors and study halls.
Shapes emerge from dark corners. Eerie sounds draw closer. Slimy passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will feed your nightmares for weeks.
THE LURKING HORROR recalls the ghastly visions of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world into a frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will challenge both first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's chilling descriptions will leave you with images you'll never forget.</Description>

		<Description>It's you against yourself. And the clock. Easy enough. Except for the barrage of barriers that stand between you and the finish line. And, oh yes, little inconveniences such as rats the size of cars eager to leave a sharp impression on you. Don't let that stop you. After all, the measure of true success is the amount of obstacles one must overcome. Like hurdles that bring to mind skyscrapers. And big barrels, as in rolling right at your legs. And potholes. Jump on a skateboard and speed over the green slime tiles. Ever wonder what it would feel like to get shot out of a cannon? There're springboards along the course that'll shoot you through mid-air like a surface-to-air missile. Save your breath. There are 24 levels in all and each gets harder and harder as you go along. Metrocross - the fastest, most challenging, most cockamamie course ever conceived by man or beast.</Description>

		<Description>More ghosts haunt the misty seacoast and stone ramparts of Cornwall than anyplace else on earth. One such soul roams Tresyllian Castle: a pale phantom with flaxen hair and a luminous, flowing gown. It seems like a fanciful legend... until the spectral "White Lady" threatens the life of your friend Tamara!
Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of eccentric characters ranging from a blue-blood debutante to an overly helpful butler. Has one of them donned the ghostly guise of the White Lady? Or has the drowned lover of Lord Jack, Tamara's fiancé, returned to haunt her successor? Perhaps the spectre is seeking the valuable treasure hidden somewhere in the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the castle. The solution to the mystery, as well as the location of the treasure, changes in each of the four variations of MOONMIST.</Description>

NERVE - you're behind the wheel of a supertuned race car with one speed only: fast. SKILL - you're maneuvering a car that can nearly reach a simulated 270 KMH. BRAINS - because you're in control of your car's speed and handling at a dangerous pace, you have to use your head and not just your hands to survive. So get geared for the ride of your life and stay alert. The track may look terrific, but at these speeds anything can turn into a danger zone.</Description>

Vast subterranean cities evolved, but in isolation. Today, the only link between these underground cities is the old network of surface freeways now ruled by anarchic gangs of outcasts, known wholly as surface dwellers.

Their only passion in life is their customized cars; pre-apocalypse vehicles dragged underground and rebuilt; rebuilt for speed and survival!

The Pawn represents all its characters and objects as if they existed in a real world, storing complex information about their attributes and properties linked to their particular position or context in the game. Your objectives are manyfold: The simplest is to escape from Kerovnia, but you will find others as you wander about the land and communicate with the characters you meet. The Pawn combines a rich text adventure with stunning color graphics and a language parser that will set the standards for years to come!</Description>

		<Description>In the 17th century, the seas are as wild as the untamed heart of a young woman. But when you set out on the schooner Lafond Deux, bound for the West Indies, your thoughts are only of your ailing father who awaits your care. Little do you know that you innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous adventure.
You barely survive an encounter with pirates, whose plans for you include a fate worse than death. The explosives, the rocky reefs, the vicious crocodile-all these are obstacles which you must overcome with cunning and agility. True, it's not easy; but at least you can control your fate. What you cannot control is much more dangerous: your passion for Nicholas Jamison, the handsome pirate captain.
Tall and lean, with azure eyes that penetrate deep into your soul, he makes your blood quicken despite his unsavory past. When you're in his arms, swirling around the dance floor or secluded in the flowered depths of the gazebo, you are apt to forget your mission.
But don't dally too long with Nick. For your father is waiting, and on his rescue lies the fate of more than one man. Prepare for adventure on the high seas, lass. You'll need every bit of pluck you can muster.
In PLUNDERED HEARTS, Infocom brings your wildest fantasies to life. You'll thrill to spine-tingling peril, heart-pounding romance, and challenging predicaments. To create this exotic adventure, author Amy Briggs read hundreds of romance novels, researched 17th century costumes and ships, and was wooed by a dashing pirate.</Description>

		<Description>The truly great games are those with simple rules. QUADREL is a perfect example of this, adapting the famous four color theory. It may be played alone against the computer or by two people. The principle of the game is to take turns to paint in a picture frame consisting of different sized boxes. As there are a fixed number of colors, the difficulty lies in the fact that two identical colors must not be placed side by side. The loser is therefore the one who cannot respect this rule with his remaining colors, or exceeds his allotted time.</Description>

		<Description>A sadistic crime wave is sweeping through Old Detroit. The situation is explosive - in fact, it is so bad a private corporation, O.C.P., has assumed control of the police force. Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named ROBOCOP! As ROBOCOP you are programmed to 1) Serve the public trust, 2) Uphold the law, and 3) Protect the innocent as you blast your way through city streets. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including ROBOCOP's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see ROBOCOP eliminated. Make your way past street thugs, the notorious Clarence Boddiker and the powerful Ed-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play! It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of Old Detroit - it's going to take ROBOCOP!</Description>

It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you!</Description>

		<Description>He's back! Slightly returns in an authentic remake of the original classic arcade adventure.

Bigwiz the wizard has left the castle in a hurry, in order to turn the Kings son Newton back into a frog. Indeed, he was in such a hurry that he forgot to pack his spare wand, forgot to lock his laboratory door, and most importantly, forgot to return his utterly stupid, idiotic, incompetent, brain-dead nephew Slightly to his parents mud hut in the hills.

Oh well, it could be worse. A sunburnt dragon could be running off with the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak. The wizards spell cabinet might have been knocked over by a Flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering the spells everywhere. His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind panic, have given Slightly the wizards private spell book to read. It might rain.

You see, it could be worse. But as it is, theres not a cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragons breath to be sniffed. Hang on, wheres that pink fire-breathing creature going with that screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or is it something stronger?

Oh no. Get the washing in mother, and lock all doors. Cancel the papers, and shoot the cow. I think its going to be one of those days</Description>

		<Description>You're at the controls of LUKE's X-WING FIGHTER, heading straight for the DEATH STAR. Your mission: to destroy it before the EMPIRE seeks its revenge on the REBEL base. Lock your sights on attacking TIE FIGHTERS and blast them with your proton torpedoes. Race along the DEATH STAR's surface, firing on giant towers. Finally, dive full throttle into the DEATH STAR's equatorial trench. You'll need split-second timing to avoid all the obstacles as you streak through the trench in search of the main reactor. Hit it and you've blown the DEATH STAR out of existence! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.</Description>

On the second and third levels you control Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian as he flies the Millenium Falcon. Lando flies close to the Death Star fighting off a mighty attack from TIE Fighters. The Millenium Falcon enters the Death Star and travels down a dangerous corridor towards the central reactor. Blast the reactor and then turn around to get away from the Death Star as it blows up!</Description>

		<Description>Stand by, Strider. Upon receiving your orders from the commander, you are dropped into the heart of Russia, armed with only your lightning-quick sword. Your task is to infiltrate the Red Army and return enemy secrets to your superiors. Your mission begins in Red Square, but after fighting off KGB attacks there, your clues lead you to the snow-capped mountains of Siberia to battle both the elements and the enemy. If you survive this icy test, your orders are to proceed south to the Lowlands where jungle tribes wait with spears and poison arrows. Now you must return to Moscow to face the Grand Master of the Red Army. It is vital that you get to him before he destroys you or the world will fall under Russian control. The free world relies on your success!</Description>

You can select either practice or combat level, with a skill level of pilot, commander or ace. At the end of each mission your score is given, calculated on the basis of your distance from the enemy HQ.</Description>

		<Description>Open the throttle fully and 'pull g'. Your turbo-charged V8 engine hugs banked curves before climbing up and away off a ramp hundreds of feet above the ground. Glide past your opponent in mid-air before crashing back onto the track, your chassis shuddering and tires squealing. No time to look back - the next bend looms and you're still not in full control! As a Stunt Car Racer, you're blasting around eight roller-coaster tracks at over 200 miles an hour, pitting your wits and high speed driving skills against computer controlled opponents or a friend via a datalink cable, all in amazingly fast, smooth 3D graphics. If you survive to become Division One champion, you're in the Superleague with a machine twice as powerful. Stop your car breaking up under the strain and then accelerate still further. There are no prizes for second place in this game - It's all or nothing!</Description>

		<Description>In 2050 the first wave of colonists left Earth for the nearby solar system of Tau Ceti, as the first wave of man's greatest adventure. On the inhospitable desert world of Tau Ceti III, a new life began. In 90 years thirty great cities were built, until without warning a great plague decimated the new world. The remaining desperate colonists were evacuated and in time a cure was found. An expedition force was dispatched and then destroyed by the now-malfunctioning defense systems. The only way to incapacitate the automatic defenders was to shut down the massive fusion reactor that fueled the planet. It was decided that a single highly skilled pilot in an armed ground skimmer might succeed where 50 would surely fall. Like a fool, you volunteered.</Description>

		<Description>The Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles are out to rescue lovely April O'Neil, who's been captured by Shredder - a maniac more menacing than an army of mind-altered Bruce Lees. But if they're to succeed, you must command the role of each turtle, rumbling through 6 New York territories patrolled by Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly Foot Clan. Along the way you'll encounter Mouser infested sewers, criminally polluted rivers, and villainous streets run by the terrorist team of Rocksteady and Bebop. So grab your nunchukus and prepare to put yourself in someone else's shell. Because in this to-the-death adventure, you'll control every leap, chop, slice and dice, until you knock heads with Shredder and either splatter him senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup.</Description>

		<Description>A brand new version of the world's favorite board game created for your computer. The game is based on answering delightfully trivial questions, but the rest is completely new. It's 2045 AD and the earth is a dying planet. Centuries of pollution have left their legacy, and the world has become victim of the 'greenhouse' effect. The object of the game is to reach the faraway, but habitable, planet Genus 2. You do this by blasting off from earth in your spacecraft, traveling through 6 different galaxies, picking up objects on mysterious planets on the way, successfully landing on Genus 2 and satisfying the elders that you are worthy enough to stay. Answer questions at each stage of the journey.</Description>

Your friends and neighbors lived in peace. Until the Rogue gang got too big for their britches. You chilled, hoping things wouldn't get too rough. No such luck. They've taken your girlfriend Maria, and there's only one thing you can do... get her back... anyway you can! You have fists of steel! Legs like pistons! And courage that just won't quit! You will need all three because the Rogues are waiting with knives, guns and a whole bunch of nasty punks. And you'll have to fight fast. If the Rogues make it back to their headquarters before you rescue Maria, all hope will be lost. But catch them first and you'll fight the leader of the Rogues. Win Maria... and your turf... will remain safe. Feel any pressure? No way. You're the Vigilante!</Description>

The destiny of Middle Earth lies in the balance. Multiple playing levels let you control all the characters and armies that appear in "The Lord of the Rings" from the broad sweep of strategy, right down to individual characters' actions on the battlefield. There are infinite possibilities so no two games will ever be the same. Gripping action means you will always want another game. Guard carefully and travel well, my friend.

Maybe you'll meet the teams of France, Italy or England who play with the unusual bravado. Long on strategy, they prove worthy contenders against the fiery speed of their Latin counterparts from Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. But nothing beats the determination of China and Japan whose team credo remains, "Never say die!". And these are just some of the twenty-four teams, our ol' red, white and blue included, who are ready to kick, dribble and shoot their way to victory.


So how will you play? Tough offense, strong defense? Only one can win. So lace up your cleats and let's see some smoke on that field.</Description>

		<Description>For a bear that's smarter than the average, life in Jellystone Park should be one long picnic. After all, everyone knows picnics mean picnic baskets! But life has taken a nasty turn. Poor little lovable Boo Boo has been "bearnapped" by a bloodthirsty hunter and is a prisoner somewhere in the Park! Heroic as ever, Yogi is on Boo Boo's trail. But Jellystone's a big place and you'll have to find plenty of tasty snacks to keep our trusty bear's strength up. Especially since along the way Yogi's pursued by angry campers, a furious Ranger, ferocious animals and homicidal hunters! Time's getting short too. Yogi's hibernation season is nearly here. So you'll need speed and a lot of bare (ouch!) cunning to rescue Boo Boo before Yogi slumps into his slumbers.</Description>
