		<Description>You are the elusive detective of the macabre, Edward Carnby. A kidnapped child depends on your super sleuthing skills and your astonishing ability to outwit bands of ruthless gangsters, smugglers and pirates. One Eyed Jack, their nefarious leader, would give him remaining eye to see you permanently retired. Are you ready for the challenge of your life?
Steel nerves and quicksilver thinking are your trademarks, so without hesitation you set out the rescue young Grace Saunders, the missing girl. Your razor sharp instincts lead you to the one place that no one in their right mind would go... One Eyed Jack's infamous hideout known as Hell's Kitchen - forbidding mansion that resonates with venomous evil.
Perched high above the unforgiving and twisting sea, Hell's Kitchen glares down at you, daring you to come closer. "One Eyed Jack is in there," you whisper under your breath. "And that little girl needs my help, if she's going to get out alive... " You begin to scale the sheer cliffs, your fate cast aside as you realize that you are alone... and in the dark again.</Description>

		<Description>What would you think if your best friend went on a date with the King of the Dark World - because she thought he was cute?! You'd think she'd been duped - and you'd be right. The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! Yuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one - and you will control her. She is to become the greatest warrior in the universe, never suspecting that her most fearsome battle will not be  against a Dark Lord, but against her closest friend from the Human World - the one she warned, "Don't go out with him, he's the Dark..." But before she could finish, her friend ran off into The Darkness.</Description>

		<Description>An entire planet becomes your laboratory in this large-scale simulation game. Players help foster new life and promote its evolution into lifeforms of higher intelligence. Guide civilization along the path of evolution until it can achieve Exodus, the ultimate goal of settling on another planet. The basic challenge of the game is to maintain a comfortable environment for the lifeforms by adjusting atmosphere and geological parameters. Small organisms called Prokaryote and Trichordate will grow and evolve into a multitude of lifeforms. Making a drastic change is a recipe for disaster. The key to success is to make small adjustments and see how the lifeforms react. SimEarth also includes planets with environments different from Earth, such as Mars and Venus. Try your hand at terraforming these planets with harsh conditions into a world where life can thrive.</Description>
