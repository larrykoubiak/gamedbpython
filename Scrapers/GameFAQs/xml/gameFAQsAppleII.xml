		<Description>There's a board. There are pieces with varying powers, squares to move into and an opponent to conquer. But the squares keep changing. And once you decide where to attack, the board explodes into a battlefield. Your pieces include phoenixes, golems and wizards, and they use all their strange powers when they fight the banshees, goblins and sorceresses they face. They cast spells and missiles, they pummel, pierce and throw out flames, they move each other around, take on each other's shapes and shriek at each other. If you square off on a spot that stays favorable, you'll be hard to kill. If you're smart, fast, dextrous and farsighted, you may win. If you're not, look for another game.</Description>

		<Description>There's a board. There are pieces with varying powers, squares to move into and an opponent to conquer. But the squares keep changing. And once you decide where to attack, the board explodes into a battlefield. Your pieces include phoenixes, golems and wizards, and they use all their strange powers when they fight the banshees, goblins and sorceresses they face. They cast spells and missiles, they pummel, pierce and throw out flames, they move each other around, take on each other's shapes and shriek at each other. If you square off on a spot that stays favorable, you'll be hard to kill. If you're smart, fast, dextrous and farsighted, you may win. If you're not, look for another game.</Description>

		<Description>It has been more than 40 years since the first nuclear bomb exploded. In that time, the shape of the world has changed dramatically. The power to destroy civilization rests in the hands of the superpowers and now, as either the President of the U.S. or as the General Secretary of the U.S.S.R., you have total responsibility for your nation's course. To succeed, you must enhance your country's prestige without infringing too much on your adversary's interests. If you play the isolationist, you will find yourself alone in a world dominated by your opponent. If you are too aggressive, you could unleash the war that annihilates humankind - and both sides lose. Balance of Power uses a huge statistical database, a meticulously detailed display of the world, and advanced artificial intelligence techniques to put you in command of one of the world's superpowers. You have vast amounts of information available as you press your country's interest and resist the pressure of the other side. Noted game designer Chris Crawford has created a model of the world which will entertain, educate, challenge and perhaps frighten you in ways no computer game has done before.</Description>

		<Description>Danger in the first degree. Open on a sultry, rather unremarkable big-city afternoon. Focus on a sweaty, sort of sloppy small-time PI's office. The drowsy detective is rudely jerked back to consciousness by his telephone's nasty jangle: "Sam, you're a dead man." Seems things have suddenly gotten very personal. A definitely unsettling how-do-you-do. But who in the world could be the perpetrator? And why? "Sam, you're a dead man." There are 20 serious suspects. And, unfortunately for Sam, it seems each one wants to throw the first clump of dirt on his coffin. "Sam, you're a dead man." A smart gumshoe will turn his old casefiles - and the city - upside down to find the fiend. A smarter gumshoe will also turn and constantly check his flanks. Seems Sam's been put in the rather precarious position of trying to skin a cat without getting skinned alive. "Sam, you're a dead man." And the one man who can help with a few precious clues and tidbits of info just happens to be blind. "Sam, you're a dead man." "Sam, you're a dead man." Guess who's Sam. Have a nice day.</Description>

		<Description>Championship Baseball has it all. You begin by drafting a team. Look over the talent pool. You'll need starting pitchers, relievers, infielders, outfielders, even utility players for bench strength. Consider each player's talents carefully before putting them on your team. Once you've selected your team, set your batting order. Then choose which of the four divisions suits you, and play ball! Championship Baseball gives you more options. You may want to start with some batting practice to master the fine art of hitting a screwball. Then, challenge a friend or the computer to 9 innings of intense action. When you're ready, pick your team and enter the 4-division, 24-team race for the pennant! You control all the action - pitching, hitting, catching, outfield relays, base running, even sliding under tags. All in the most realistic baseball simulation you can find!</Description>

Ambushed, captured, and knocked unconscious, you awake with no idea who attacked you or how you arrived in Tilverton. You only know that five azure-blue symbols are imprinted just under the skin of your right arm.
The mystical power of the azure symbols ensnares your will like metal bonds! And when the bonds glow, you must do as they command. No magic dispels the bonds and no cleric's prayers remove them.
Your only hope: search the Forgotten Realms for members of the alliance who created the bonds and regain control of your own destiny. Only then can you be free of the Curse of the Azure Bonds.</Description>

		<Description>Can you survive the haunted house on the hill? From the moment the creaking drawbridge closes behind you until you slay the Black Knight, Dark Castle is a non-stop life and death adventure. Pitting you against the evil that threatens you at every turn, Dark Castle requires that you think quick, act fast and have a real zest for life. Where will your adventure take you? Through dungeons, laboratories and caves. Up and down ladders and ropes. Over trap doors. Past whip-cracking henchmen and Merlin the Magician, all of whom kill first, then ask questions. By creepy crawlers, kamikazee vultures and other mutants of mischief. And the more elusive you are, the more difficult it gets. Dark Castle has you looking over your shoulder as soon as your hunt for the Black Knight begins. Are you a hero? Or are you history?</Description>

		<Description>Are you clever enough to solve an evil wizard's twisted puzzles? Do you possess the concentration needed to explore a labyrinth of mystery? Should you resist the tempting treasures, defeat the hideous monsters, and escape the devious traps that are hidden throughout the Grey Lord's dreadful dungeon?
Yes? Then perhaps you'll be the one to enter the caves of the sacred mountain and retrieve the Firestaff from the evil Lord Chaos. To succeed, you must assemble a band of four champions and lead them in fierce battles against the terrible Dark Lord who now rules your master's dungeon.
And if you fail? At best, you'll meet your ghastly end in the dungeon's wretched catacombs, like hundreds of brave adventurers who went before you. Far worse, you might become a captive "trophy" of the evil Lord Chaos, suspended forever in the haunting mirrors of the Hall of Champions.</Description>

		<Description>Be prepared for a spectacular adventure; three times larger than any previous Sierra adventure, a landmark in computer gaming that transcends existing standards of computer graphics, sound and animation.
Powerfully dramatic, King's Quest IV evokes emotion like no other computer game with a unique combination of lifelike animated personalities, beautiful landscapes, and soul-stirring music. Sierra has recreated the universe of King's Quest, a world that one moment will pull at your heartstrings, the next moment place terror in your heart. Uniting the best programmers, artists, and musicians in the business, Sierra has created a constantly evolving universe where landscapes change from day to night, characters roam freely, and dramatic music interhides tantalize your emotions in a complicated tale of faith and mistrust. Your quest begins with a full-length cartoon and proceeds to plunge you into a fantasy world of mystery, intrigue and enough plot twists to confound even the most dedicated adventurer.
Embark upon a perilous journey into the darkest corners of the King's Quest universe. Not one, but many successful quests must be completed to save the royal family from strategy destiny. With a surprise introduction and an equally unexpected conclusion, plot twists abound as you strive to discover the mysteries of a strange land, overcome its hostile inhabitants, and reveal the secrets hidden therein.
Roam the grounds at night and discover areas which remain hidden during daylight hours. Travel swiftly, as time is of the essence, and each moment brings the royal family closer to ruin.</Description>

		<Description>Little people have been living inside computers for years, playing tricks on computer owners, but remaining hidden from view. Now they have been tempted into the open... This box contains a "house on a disc": load the disc onto your computer and the on-screen house will attract a little computer person from the depths of your computer, and he will make it his permanent residence. Then the responsibility begins - your new friend needs to be kept happy, well fed and watered. Ignore his physical needs and your new pal gets miserable, fades away, and might even die... Pander to his needs and he will play you records, write you letters, even beat you at cards!  Build up a relationship with your Little Computer Person, and you'll find it increasingly difficult to turn the computer off and wave him goodbye.</Description>

		<Description>Ever since you arrived at G.U.E. Tech, you've heard stories about the creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some so ancient that they contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable junk. Until now, you've never ventured lower than the ground floors of the monolithic classroom and dorm buildings, avoiding the warren of tunnels that connect them.
But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths of the institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside, making the outdoors as threatening as anything you could imagine within. Perhaps it's the nightmare you had, hinting at horrific mysteries below and leaving you with a strange object that seems to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps it's just another way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper you have due tomorrow.
In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your computer and into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly, you're in a world that rivals your most hideos visions, a realm of horror lurking beneath the calm corridors and study halls.
Shapes emerge from dark corners. Eerie sounds draw closer. Slimy passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will feed your nightmares for weeks.
THE LURKING HORROR recalls the ghastly visions of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world into a frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will challenge both first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's chilling descriptions will leave you with images you'll never forget.</Description>

		<Description>It's 1031. The world is on the brink of chaos. In the United States of North America, spiraling crime and unemployment rates, decayed school systems and massive government regulations have led to a lazy, contentious society.
To reverse this critical situation, government and industry leaders have developed a Plan combining the economic freedom and strong moral values of the 1950's with the technological advancements of the 21st century. Will the Plan ensure peace and prosperity? Or will it set the earth on a suicide course to destruction?
As the world's first conscious, intelligent computer, only you can visit places that have never been seen before. Only you can view the future. And only you know what must be done to save humanity. A major departure for Infocom, A Mind Forever Voyaging is reminiscent of such classic works of science fiction as Brave New World and 1984. You'll spend less time solving puzzles, as you explore realistic worlds of the future.</Description>

		<Description>More ghosts haunt the misty seacoast and stone ramparts of Cornwall than anyplace else on earth. One such soul roams Tresyllian Castle: a pale phantom with flaxen hair and a luminous, flowing gown. It seems like a fanciful legend... until the spectral "White Lady" threatens the life of your friend Tamara!
Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of eccentric characters ranging from a blue-blood debutante to an overly helpful butler. Has one of them donned the ghostly guise of the White Lady? Or has the drowned lover of Lord Jack, Tamara's fiancé, returned to haunt her successor? Perhaps the spectre is seeking the valuable treasure hidden somewhere in the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the castle. The solution to the mystery, as well as the location of the treasure, changes in each of the four variations of MOONMIST.</Description>

Or of a roaring, uncharted underground tributary of the Urubamba River replete with waterfalls and deadly electric eels. "Yes," I said. He asked if I knew of the infamous, cursed Raj Diamond. Or of the recent robbery of gold bars from the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. And had I heard of vampire bats? Poisonous frogs? Albino scorpions? The dreaded Andean condor? "Yes," I said. And could I still run? Climb? Jump? Could I... swim? "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes." "Good," said Crane. "Then you'll do it?" "Of course," I said. If only I had known...</Description>

		<Description>In the 17th century, the seas are as wild as the untamed heart of a young woman. But when you set out on the schooner Lafond Deux, bound for the West Indies, your thoughts are only of your ailing father who awaits your care. Little do you know that you innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous adventure.
You barely survive an encounter with pirates, whose plans for you include a fate worse than death. The explosives, the rocky reefs, the vicious crocodile-all these are obstacles which you must overcome with cunning and agility. True, it's not easy; but at least you can control your fate. What you cannot control is much more dangerous: your passion for Nicholas Jamison, the handsome pirate captain.
Tall and lean, with azure eyes that penetrate deep into your soul, he makes your blood quicken despite his unsavory past. When you're in his arms, swirling around the dance floor or secluded in the flowered depths of the gazebo, you are apt to forget your mission.
But don't dally too long with Nick. For your father is waiting, and on his rescue lies the fate of more than one man. Prepare for adventure on the high seas, lass. You'll need every bit of pluck you can muster.
In PLUNDERED HEARTS, Infocom brings your wildest fantasies to life. You'll thrill to spine-tingling peril, heart-pounding romance, and challenging predicaments. To create this exotic adventure, author Amy Briggs read hundreds of romance novels, researched 17th century costumes and ships, and was wooed by a dashing pirate.</Description>

		<Description>Sure Summer Games was great, but why stop there? Summer Games II will take you even farther with eight challenging, new events. You and up to seven other contestants can compete in your favorite individual event or go for it all in teh grand competition. Some events, like cycling, rowing and fencing even challenge you with realistic head-to-head competition.
First, decide which of the 18 different countries you're going to represent. Then, in true Olympic fashion, you will need the proper strategy and mental toughness, not just speed and agility to excel in each of the eight events. That's why we included a feature that lets you practice each event until you're ready for the real competition.
Remember, it's not too early to get ready for 1988. With the right diet, proper training and lots of practice you just might make it. In the meantime, put on your sweatsuit, grab that joystick and let Summer Games II give you eight new ways to Go For The Gold!</Description>

		<Description>Upon escaping the crumbling ruins of Shadowguard, the black fortress of Minax, you lay your weary body on the now-sacred ground. As you rest, you remember your first encounter with the evil wizard of Mondain, whom you later tracked down and destroyed. The existence of his apprentice, Minax, was soon revealed and the crusade was begun again. Younger and more cunning than her mentor, she has been much more difficult to vanquish. But now your sense of accomplishment is touched by a chilling fear. Have all vestiges of evil been removed? Somehow, you sense that your treacherous foes have not been eliminated. Without further feats of skill, daring and perseverance, all of your past accomplishments may be lost. You stand up, prepare your armor, and walk to the dimension door. Stepping in, the hunt resumes.</Description>

		<Description>Prepare yourself for a grand adventure: Ultima IV, sixteen times larger than Ultima III, is a milestone in computer gaming. Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>

		<Description>CIVILIZATION'S LAST STAND!

Mutants. Again. Even more than there were last time: they seem to materialize out of the very grains of the radioactive desert sand. Venomous yellow eyes. The black gunmetal glint of Uzis as they close in for the kill. There's nowhere to run, and nothing to rely on but your MAC 17 machine gun. What a way to save the human race.

MORE REAL THAN YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE!
* Roam the deserts of the American Southwest. Neon lights never made Las Vegas glow like this.
* All your actions are permanent. If you blow up the library, don't expect to check out books later.
* No swords, no spells. Pistols, rockets, submachine guns, laser weapons, and cunning are all the magic you need.

STRATEGY IS EVERYTHING!
* A whole new dimension in tactical combat. 
* Plan your attack. Split up your party at any time and put your specialists to work.
* Burn the whole clip. Fire in shot bursts. Or do the job with just one shot. How lucky do you feel?

EXPLOSIVE STORYLINE!
* Your characters gain real knowledge. Pick locks. Fire rockets. Disarm bombs. Decode messages. Learn survival skills that weren't in the Boy Scout manual.
* A cast of hundreds. Everyone wants to meet you -- most of them in the worst possible way.
* Plenty of subplots, intricate puzzles, and graphic surprises await in the vast nightmare of a post-nuclear world. 

LOTS OF EXTRAS!
* Top-down views like Deathlord, close-up characters like The Bard's Tale.
* Extra booklet details encounters with strange desert inhabitants.
* From the creators of The Bard's Tale series.</Description>

		<Description>Are you ready to step into the world of Wizardry? Unmatched by any other fantasy role-playing game, the Wizardry Gaming System allows for unlimited combinations of strategies and tactics, so that each quest into the Maze is always fresh and interesting.
Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first Wizardry scenario. Starting in the Castle, you assemble one to six adventurers to explore the magic and mystery of the ten-level 3-D Maze. Your characters may be one of five races and eight professions, each with strengths and weaknesses.
Under your command, brawny warriors, frail magis, pious clerics, and nimble thieves accumulate experience and treasure. As your characters gain experience, they develop greater capabilities to become even better adventurers, allowing them to venture deeper into the Maze.
Be wary! The treacherous Maze has some tricks and traps of its own. Hundreds of monsters, many with magical powers equal to your own; pits; chutes; rotating rooms; teleporters; special one-of-a-kind surprises; and much more will keep you on your toes for many hours of fun. May luck and good fortune be your companions!</Description>
