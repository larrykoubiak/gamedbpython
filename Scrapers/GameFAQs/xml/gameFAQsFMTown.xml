		<Description>A suspicious suicide. A chilling curse. A malevolent power. And a wicked dark secret. This is Derceto, legendary Louisiana mansion - where, against your better judgement, you're drawn into a world of shadows to explore the darker side of Jeremy Hartwood's imagination. Despite a paralyzing sense of personal danger, your quest for truth drives you to investigate the old house. But, you didn't know that by entering Derceto, you'd be plunged into the daily nightmare that was Jeremy Hartwood's life. You weren't prepared for the torturous howls that resound from deep within its halls. You didn't foresee the shadowy corridors that seemingly have no end. You couldn't anticipate the brooding, gloom-filled rooms, the pervasive weight of dread, the heavy sense of evil that fills the atmosphere and teh very house itself. Had you known, you might have refused your task. But alas, you accepted, and now you must make your way through this spine-tingling adventure alone... and in the dark.</Description>

		<Description>It's the summer of 1937 and the dark clouds of war loom on the distant horizon, but enigmatic industrialist Bronson Barnard has other matters on his mind. Barnard has invited a select group of guests for the historic maiden launch of his latest triumph-the magnificent flying boat Condor. As the Trans-Atlantic jaunt from Baltimore to Lisbon begins, the champagne flows and the posh party-goers revel in elegance and splendor. But, they have yet to realize that their gracious host has set a gilded trap for a murderer.
Barnard hopes to demonstrate his amateur sleuthing skills to his old war buddy, private detective, Ned Peters, while exposing the killer of a U.S. Customs official, Gerald Weltner. Why is Barnard seeking justice for this deplorable deed? Unbeknownst to the unsuspecting suspects, Weltner was Bernard's illegitimate son!
But, a sudden heart attack foils Barnard's plan and the Condor must be turned back. Before he loses consciousness, he entrusts his secret to Peters and implores him to step in and solve the crime. With only thirty minutes before they land. It's a challenge for even a pro like Peters to unravel this mystery. So lend a hand and catch a killer in The Case of the Cautious Condor.</Description>

In this mesmerizing pastime, tinker with your riches to align glittering jewels across, down, or diagonally. As you line up colors, the gems vanish and more sparklers drop from above. The challenge increases as the jewels fall more rapidly. You must quickly align them before the columns reach the top. You don't have to be a joystick whiz to excel, even at the hardest levels. Try Flash Columns and make a flashing jewel disappear before time runs out. Enjoy solitary games, or play with a friend. Imagine yourself on the warm Mediterranean coast, or drifting over a languid sea. Forget the passage of time, and tickle your mind with Columns, the brilliant game of strategy and skill.</Description>

		<Description>Are you clever enough to solve an evil wizard's twisted puzzles? Do you possess the concentration needed to explore a labyrinth of mystery? Should you resist the tempting treasures, defeat the hideous monsters, and escape the devious traps that are hidden throughout the Grey Lord's dreadful dungeon?
Yes? Then perhaps you'll be the one to enter the caves of the sacred mountain and retrieve the Firestaff from the evil Lord Chaos. To succeed, you must assemble a band of four champions and lead them in fierce battles against the terrible Dark Lord who now rules your master's dungeon.
And if you fail? At best, you'll meet your ghastly end in the dungeon's wretched catacombs, like hundreds of brave adventurers who went before you. Far worse, you might become a captive "trophy" of the evil Lord Chaos, suspended forever in the haunting mirrors of the Hall of Champions.</Description>

Ill-prepared and outgunned, Earth scientists worked feverishly to build a weapon to turn the tide. The "OF-1" is the ultimate fighter. Even as the crews prepare to fight, industrial and military space complexes disappear, one by one. Viewing screens, hooked to spy satellites, flash images of unidentified fighter attacks and a strange vegetation coiling itself around the moon's computer like an insidious serpent. Victory will come only to the worthy. Are you?</Description>

		<Description>Two ways to play! 1: Solve any one of 200 fully animated puzzles. Read or listen to the puzzle goals (Get Mel home safely). Yikes! Can you climb there from here? Try to eye a possible path. Next, rummage through the over 50 nifty doodads and wacky devices in the Parts Bin. Pull out the ones you want and build a solution. Several zillion combinations are possible, but you need one that works! Now crank up your machine and hang on! See if your construction strategy solves the puzzle. If so, your brain will feel really good. If not, don't fret - try again! 2: Build your own puzzle. Just strap on your inventor's helmet, enter Make a Machine Mode, and create the wildest contraption you can dream up. Create puzzles from the 50+ parts in The Incredible Machine for your friends and family to solve.</Description>

		<Description>Long after the passing of the Second Shadow, when dragons ruled the twilight sky and the stars were bright and numerous, came the Age of the Great Guilds. Blacksmiths, Shepherds, Clerics. Each dedicated to the absolute control of secret knowledge. Another such Guild was the Weavers. Over the centuries, their craft transcended the limits of physical cloth, until they wove the very fabric of reality itself. Now, a strange power has swept the Weavers into oblivion, leaving behind one Weaver boy to unravel the mystery. Help young Bobbin rescue his Guild...and you just might save the universe from an unspeakable catastrophe.</Description>

		<Description>In LeChuck's Revenge Guybrush Threepwood returns in his search for the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. He is now a genuine pirate and has traded in his white shirt and clean shaved face for a dashing blue coat and a beard. This would not be a true sequel if we did not see the return of the villain LeChuck and so, in the true spirit of Monkey Island, Guybrush accidentally helps to bring back LeChuck who, of course, wants revenge. The game itself has evolved much since the original. It feels about four times bigger and includes four different islands. Some of the puzzles are very hard and therefore you can select to play the game on "easy mode" for beginners.</Description>

		<Description>Steady your nerves and concentration. You're about to play Shanghai! Shanghai is based on an ancient game that's over 25 centuries old. Over the years since, it has been a favorite of pirates and smugglers, flappers and gangsters, of working men and the well-to-do. Now you can play it too! The game is simple... the strategy complex. Remove 144 tiles from a pyramid; two matching tiles at a time. But be careful. Remove the wrong two tiles and you're left with no more matching pairs... game over! It's a game everyone can play and enjoy.</Description>

Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>

		<Description>To commemorate the defeat of the Guardian's forces one year ago, you (the Avatar™) and the leaders of Britannia are invited to Lord British's castle for an evening of celebration. Suddenly, the Guardian strikes again, encasing the building in a gigantic blackrock gem. He offers the imprisoned heroes a simple choice: proclaim him ruler of all Britannia, or starve while his minions conquer the land.
Searching underground for an escape route, you discover a smaller version of the gem that surrounds the castle, and find that its facets are portals to other worlds. These worlds are also under the Guardian's domination, but with your help, the inhabitants may be able to throw off the evil titan's yoke.
Time is running out, food and water are running low, and an agent of the Guardian is killing off the imprisoned heroes one by one. You hold Britannia's fate in your hands once again.</Description>

		<Description>Many years have passed since your last visit to Britannia. Little did you expect that, when you returned, you would be accused of kidnapping Baron Almric's daughter, Arial - and then be thrown into the Great Abyss, without so much as a chance to prove your innocence.
Only by surviving the dangers of the Abyss and finding the villain who abducted Arial can you restore your good name. But dark hints garnered from all corners of the Abyss reveal that this was no simple kidnapping. The fate of Britannia hangs in the balance as you battle the horrors that lurk as the heart of the Great Stygian Abyss.</Description>

		<Description>Ten years ago, you were the Hero of Vega Sector, idol of millions-the starfighter pilot who single-handedly turned the tide of a major Kilrathi invasion.
Then something went wrong.
You were disgraced, court-martialed and transferred to a backwater outpost. For years, your lightning-quick reflexes and instinctive dogfighting tactics went to waste while the Kilrathi killed your closest friends on the front lines.
But Mankind still needs a hero, now more than ever before. And you're still the best pilot in the Galaxy. You've got just one chance to prove yourself, just one chance to keep the Terran homeworlds from falling to the massed armada of the Empire of Kilrah.</Description>

AFter years of following orders and losing ships and friends, you are now the sole commander, responsible for heading up a momentous strike against your enemy's homeland - either the Empire of Kilrah or the heart of the Confederation. This war requires real strategy, not just hotshot piloting, and you have to determine where to fight, how to fight, and what ships will get the job done. In Wind Armada, you have the freedom to build your own universe, your own missions and your own campaign.</Description>

You head the special police force known as the A.S.S.P., whose ranks are composed of genetically engineered android Biosoldiers, women programmed in advanced squad-based combat.
