		<Description>20,000 years in the future, mankind has built a giant supercomputer named DARK to rule the planet. For hundreds of years, DARK has governed with wisdom and justice. But now the unthinkable has happened: DARK is malfunctioning, and humanity is writhing in the grasp of a ruthless tyrant. DARK has built a fleet of robot warships to patrol the skies, and has created an army of mutant monsters to guard the underground bases from which he now terrorizes mankind. Lulled by hundreds of years of peace, the people of earth are defensless against the minions of DARK. But two brave young men, following an ancient legend of Greek mythology, have devised mechanical wings to bear them aloft in search of DARK's hidden fortress. Armed with the last remaining guns and missiles from a crumbling arsenal, you must fly them across the continents and oceans to seek out and destroy the cruel colossus! If you fail, mankind is lost. Take wing, Legendary Soldiers!</Description>

		<Description>This is the sequel to the infamous Atari® classic, Asteroids® where you must blast all the asteroids to pieces in the given time. Sounds familiar but this time there are deadly enemies such as UFOs and Killer Satellites, which will chase and shoot at you as you try to complete your quest. Use your shield to protect you against a fatal collision but use it sparingly as this shield will deplete every time your ship is hit. Help is at hand in the form of pickups, which will emerge from the debris of the destroyed asteroids. They can give you more blasting power and provide you with extra time to cope with the onslaught of attacks.

Asteroids® Deluxe™ contains all the action of the original and more with new and improved graphics, faster game play, dangerous enemies and as much master-blasting fun as you can handle. You only have 3 lives and a limited time - use it well!</Description>

		<Description>The Last Blade 2, originally released in 1998, is the sequel to the fighting game, The Last Blade, which was released a year before. It picks up where the previous title left off and takes the story of battling at the gates of hell to its climax. This time around, there are 16 unique swordsmen from which to choose. Choose from 2 sword types (Strength and Attack). Deflect your enemy's attacks with "Repel". You can also cancel game-changing special moves like "Super Secret Slice" or "Hidden Secret Slice" with a "Sublime Slash", which connects to Super Secret Slice - just like in the previous title. And there are even some new features like aerial repels, aerial guards and knockdown recovery. Take your battles to a whole 'nother level!</Description>

Whether pitching or at bat, control every aspect of the game. Throw a fastball, high outside or a slider. Swing for the fences. Hit and run, bunt, steal or call for a pinch hitter.

		<Description>There was once a time when the world was engulfed in darkness. Mankind fought six battles to save their world, but lost every single one. All hope was lost for humanity. But one day the darkness was finally driven back by the swords of four heroes. Light returned to the world, and with it came peace and serenity. The world was then divided into two major countries: The Magic Kingdom and the Steam Empire. The people prospered like never before. But in recent months, rumors have spread among the people that the darkness is returning. Fate has once again brought together warriors from all over the world. Some fight in the relentless pursuit of justice, some fight due to their conviction and faith, but all must come to a solution in Battle Fantasia.
Developed by ARC System Works, creators of the highly popular Guilty Gear series, Battle Fantasia utilizes RPG-style elements and blends them with high-level fighting gameplay.</Description>

The 20-year wait is over as the first true sequel to the classic 1988 Nintendo Entertainment System original, Bionic Commando, sees the return of the bionically-enhanced Nathan "Rad" Spencer.

But then, terrorists detonate a massive experimental weapon in Ascension City, unleashing an intense earthquake that turns the city into rubble, wipes out the population, and results in the city's air defense grid in the control of a massive terrorist force. There is only one option left, a behind-the-lines assault by a Bionic Commando.</Description>

		<Description>Fight for victory in the hottest hockey game on ice! With sharpened blades and a lethal stick, you slash into a rink surrounded by thousands of screaming fans. It's time for full-speed, high contact hockey, the kind of bone-jarring action played by the pros. The puck is dropped, you take control, center it and... Whoa! Your opponent viciously checks you from behind, making an incredible steal. You charge after him, crushing him against the boards. Suddenly tempers flare, off come the gloves, and you're swinging fists like a prize fighter. What action! You can even rack up assists like the great you-know-who. Or play goalie in the slap shooting penalty scenes. So strap on Blades of Steel. And imagine those immortal words - "He shoots, he scores!"</Description>

Your job is to rotate and maneuver each of them into the proper position in order to form complete layers. As each layer is completed, it vanishes, giving you more points and more room to work. Blockout will challenge your reflexes and your resolve in a test of coordination and quick thinking. But the greatest challenge of all will be keeping yourself from playing it again and again.</Description>

		<Description>BUCKY'S GONNA NEED A LOT OF LUCK FROM HIS RABBIT'S FOOT!

Today's newest renegade space hero, Captain Bucky O'Hare, faces his greatest challenge. His crew, Dead Eye Duck, Blinky, Jenny the Aldeberan Cat and the genius earth boy Willy DuWitt, have been captured by the Toad Empire. Now you must play the role of Bucky, blasting past the fiercest toads in the Aniverse. It's an intense arcade action battle with eight hare-raising levels. Luckily, when you rescue a crew member you can assume their identity and take advantage of their unique fighting skills, like Jenny's Super Mind Blast and Willy's Laser Cannon... WE INTERUPT THIS PACKAGE FOR A SPECIAL BULLETIN FROM TOAD HEADQUARTERS!

Greetings, warthead. This is the Toad Air Marshall, coming to you live from the Toad Magma Tanker. I'm here to smash an ugly rumor goin' around that says you're thinking about becoming Bucky O'Hare in a futile attempt to rescue the captured crew of the Righteous Ingignation.

Fool! Those lunkhead traitors are guided by the elite Storm Toad Troopers in four toad prisons hidden throughout the planetoid belt, from the Way-Cool Ice Planet to the Burnin' Hunk of Lava Star. So don't even mess with us toads, you wart for brains hare-ball. 'Cause it you do, I'll have to blast ya Toad Battle Cruisers and Double Bubble High Speed Toad Armada Tanks. That ain't the worst of it, pal! Once I've got your pointy ears in my sights, I'll drop the big bomb with Crater Centipedes, Robosnakes and triple threat Triborgs that your laser-guided Wart Remover doesn't have a shot against.
Face it rabbit. Try to croak us toads, and you'll be one unlucky Bucky!</Description>

		<Description>For many years, the Casterota family, a huge crime syndicate, literally ruled over the streets of New York with overpowering control. Two police detectives named Duke Edwards and Billy King fought against the syndicate for years trying to bring to justice the leaders of this murderous clan. Then, just when Duke and Billy were closing in on the family, the Casterota fled the country to Japan. Word has it that the Casterota's have now joined forces with another crime family, the Heiwa-Gumi, and have produced a powerful team of modern-day gangsters that now control most of Osaka. Their looting and criminal activities have reached uncontrollable proportions and the one concerned detective, Ryu Saeba cannot overthrow the combined forces of the two families on his own. This is the action-packed, vandalous story of 3 detectives joining together to "once and for all" rid the world of these violent criminals. Can the endless funds of the Casterota's and the Heiwa-Gumi be depleted? Or will the massive forces of these ruthless criminals defeat the efforts of Duke, Billy, and Ryu? One thing is for certain... this jaw-crushing, leg breaking, head-buttin' battle of good guys versus bad will drag you into one helluva BURNING FIGHT!</Description>

		<Description>It's a High Fly Ball...
Going, Going, Gone!

Step into the batter's box and get ready for some heat! Move a little closer to the plate or get deep in the boxit depends on the pitch you think you'll get next. Start your base runner early to advance him with a bunt or a flat out steal second. Better yet, drill that hanging curveball into the left field bleachers for a quick two-run lead.

When you're on the mound, it's not just how fast you throw, but where you throw that counts. Move your catcher outside if you want to nip the corner, or position him inside to jam the batter for an easy popup. Keep an eye on the base runner...a pickoff play can get you out of a tough inning. Played at home or on the road, it has all the action and strategy of the real thing. Hot dogs and peanuts sold separately.

- 2 leagues, 26 teams to choose from.
- Choose from starting pitcher for each game.
- Relief pitcher and pinch hitters add to the challenge.
- Head-to-head action against a friend with Gear-to-Gear Cable (sold separately).</Description>

		<Description>The time is yesteryear, when knights scoured the countryside in search of the Holy Grail, defended the honor of fair maidens and fought a never-ending battle against rampant evil forces. Thrown into this mayhem, is the courageous Sir Arthur. A victorious knight with the awesome task of penetrating the Demon's Castle to pulverize the Prince of Darkness. Can he do it? It's up to you. You'll dangerously travel through the Place of Execution, the Village of Decay, the Town of Fire, and the Crystal Forest with an arsenal of weapons at your side. And when you're really down on your luck, magic fights might with powerful results. The only problem? You'll have to learn how to use it. And avoid it. Because their magic has the power to change you into a helpless duck among other things. But there's not much time. Lives depend on you. So brandish your sword and make mincemeat of your foes.</Description>

Dirk the Daring walked steadily toward the castle gate. He felt no fear. Fear was for cowards, not the most courageous knight in the land. No other would dare enter this perilous castle where Mordroc had imprisoned the helpless princess. But then, no other could match Dirk's unrelenting love for the beautiful Princess Daphne. There was no other possible course of action. Now was the time for heroes. Now was the time to enter the Dragon's Lair!</Description>

Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand... I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out the mess? You guessed - you get the job. Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment and time is running out.</Description>

You'll dangerously travel through the Place of Execution, the Village of Decay, the Town of Fire, and the Crystal Forest with an arsenal of weapons at your side.

It is now in the hands of the unscrupulous titan, Death-Adder. Tarik, the seasoned warrior whose skill with his giant sword is both praised and feared throughout the land, has come forth to try and wrest the Axe from the grasp of the black-hearted warlord. Help Tarik to battle the many types of bandits that Death-Adder has amassed to protect himself. Using the sword, and certain very special magical powers, guide Tarik through the gauntlet of bandits to Death-Adder's castle! He'll be waiting there for you, and he's terribly reluctant to give up the Golden Axe! Are you brave enough to bring back the Axe, and thus restore tranquility to Yuria, or will you wind up just another victim of the evil warlord?</Description>

Two years after its last epic battle, the GRADIUS army recommissions the VIC VIPER superdimensional warplane to combat the invasion of a new nemesis known as GOFER. Piloting the latest model of the VIC VIPER, players can select between multiple WEAPON MODULES and SHIELDS to tackle the varying stages and enemy attack patterns they come up against. With a total of nine stages, this perfect port of the original boasts one of the longest adventures in the series and features more of its trademark fast-paced background music to accompany the intense action!</Description>

		<Description>The gentle Gradians thought they were cured of Bacterion's contemptible curse after a generation of germ-free living. Guess again. That wretched fiend is once again wreaking havoc on Gradius and the surrounding planets. It's your destiny to put an end to it. Unless maybe you think life as an amoeba would be pleasant! You'll have to be as tough as Orakian ore to confront Bacterion and disintegrate its hailstone of a heart. If you do, all that is good in the universe will breathe a sigh of relief. And if you don't, you'll hear the echo of a solitary clap and the final dark curtain will fall.</Description>

If you're good, you'll pick off the heavily-armed enemy guerillas, one by one, and grab their bazookas and hand grenades. If you're great, you'll turn their weapons against them, to blow away a pack of attack dogs, a fleet of choppers, and a whole battalion of guards. But make one mistake, and it's all over. For you, our POWs... the future of the Free World!</Description>

		<Description>It's A.D. 2500 and mankind has penetrated the galaxy's fringes, establishing colonies of peace from Mercury to Pluto. Suddenly, the tranquility of the Milky Way erupts into a frothing fury as armadas of alien deathships swarm into our solar system like killer bees preying on an innocent bystander. No one is spared. Even beloved Mother Earth is stung. These vicious cosmic Visigoths are war starved Gyrusians. And, led by the immortal Genghis Khan (whom they recruited from Mongolia centuries ago), they're out to trash civilization. With our galactic fleet flattened, you're the lone space cowboy who escaped the Gyruss shroud of doom. Now you must scorch through the galaxy, freeing planets by zapping endless enemy attacks with Neo-Bomb-Blastic Cannons and Ultra-Lazonic Phasers. So prepare for the fight of your life. And don't flinch, or else the entire universe will get pulverized!</Description>

		<Description>The crack of blades. The crash of helmets and the duel of sticks. It's just you and your opponent in a ferocious two-minute battle across the rink. The action begins at the sound of the bell. You shoot to center ice: take the puck across the blue line, and then weave and rush to outrace your challenger to the goal. He grabs the elusive puck and then it's up to you to hook it back. Sticks fly, he takes a shot off the boards. The puck is yours again! Time is running out! You attempt the most powerful score in the game. Swing your stick back and -- slapshot! The goalie slips and looks in astonishment as the puck zips past him. It's your third goal! You've scored a Hat Trick!</Description>

		<Description>Remember Tetris? The way those cubes kept coming at you? That was tricky enough, but what if they were half a dozen different hats instead? Derbies, baseball caps, cowboy hats, wizard hats, top hats and crowns? Well, that's the whole idea behind Hatris. The hats keep coming at you two at a time. All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they're history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you'll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head. If you don't, you'll look pretty strange with that pile of hats on it!</Description>

Powerful tanks, treacherous waterways and the bridges are all part of enemy territory now. The only weapon you'll be able to defeat the terrorists with is HEAVY BARRELL - but it's been dismantled and is in pieces inside the installation itself.

		<Description>This ain't no 20-minute workout. It's the ultimate in head-to-head competition, in 8 grueling events. 100 meter dash. Long jump. Hurdles. Javelin. Skeet shooting. Triple jump. Archery. And the high jump. No timeouts, no breathers, no water boys. Just you and your own exhaustion. So get psyched. Pick your level of competition and the opening event. Then block out the roar of the crowd and take a deep breath. Because it's not whether you win or lose. It's whether you survive!</Description>

		<Description>Mankind struggles to survive! Without warning they came... And laid waste to the moon and man's bases on it. Ill-prepared and outgunned, Earth scientists worked feverishly to build a weapon to turn the tide. The "OF-1" is the ultimate fighter. Even as the crews prepare to fight, industrial and military space complexes disappear, one by one. Viewing screens, hooked to spy satellites, flash images of unidentified fighter attacks and a strange vegetation coiling itself around the moon's computer like an insidious serpent. Victory will come only to the worthy. Are you?</Description>

		<Description>The severe fun of Incredible Crisis is all about maintaining your sanity, as you help Taneo's family get home in time for Grandma's Birthday.
It's a happy day and the worst day of their life, as they endure hundreds of hilarious and cardiac-arrest inducing dilemmas.
You'll laugh, cry, freak-out and perhaps soil your shorts, while your mental and physical reflexes are put the test.
The controls are simple, but thumb and forefinger injury is still a risk.
Be warned, this game is severely fun and may cause obsessive compulsive behavior, if not nervous disorders and/or involuntary twitches.</Description>

		<Description>There was a time, thousands of years ago when 'visitors' arrived on earth and chose humans for a great experiment. They gave humans the ability to learn in order to watch them evolve and expand their minds beyond their primitive means.

Now the experiment is complete and the 'visitors' have returned to harvest their crop. At this moment, their great ships are arriving at major cities around the globe preparing to conquer and claim what is rightfully theirs... the human race.

To stop the invasion you must complete 4 separate missions by defeating the invading aliens that are abducting and mutating humans, snatching monuments and creating havoc in the world. The fate of the plant is in your hands!</Description>

Cannons, tanks, submarines and snipers will blast you with horrific crossfire, while jet fighters zero in from above. To defend yourself, you control the army's advanced all-terrain attack jeep, with its arsenal of guided missiles and incendiary grenades. Of course these are merely tools, and to save your countrymen you'll need more than a handful of gunpowder. You'll need a pocketful of miracles, and the ferocity of a wild Jackal!</Description>

		<Description>The King of Fighters XII is a pure arcade fighting title. Like a few other releases in its franchise it does not contain a storyline, instead focusing on the tried and true 3-on-3, five round team fighting gameplay mechanic. Far from a liability, the lack of storyline plays into the fighting mechanic by eliminating official teams linked to the prevailing story, which in earlier releases compromised the characters that could be added to a team. In addition, the game also features new combat elements including the "Critical Counter" system which opens up the possibility of additional linked attacks and finishing moves when players land effective counter punches following an opponent's attack, and "Clash Timing," a break effect during a bout that separates combatants when they land blows on each other at the exact same time.</Description>

Each character retains their own normal shots, as well as ultimate techniques. Each character's special move has 3 three levels at which they can be unleashed, depending on the amount of energy in your ultimate technique gauge.

		<Description>The Last Blade 2, originally released in 1998, is the sequel to the fighting game, The Last Blade, which was released a year before. It picks up where the previous title left off and takes the story of battling at the gates of hell to its climax. This time around, there are 16 unique swordsmen from which to choose. Choose from 2 sword types (Strength and Attack). Deflect your enemy's attacks with "Repel". You can also cancel game-changing special moves like "Super Secret Slice" or "Hidden Secret Slice" with a "Sublime Slash", which connects to Super Secret Slice - just like in the previous title. And there are even some new features like aerial repels, aerial guards and knockdown recovery. Take your battles to a whole 'nother level!</Description>

But now the unthinkable has happened: DARK is malfunctioning, and humanity is writhing in the grasp of a ruthless tyrant. DARK has built a fleet of robot warships to patrol the skies, and has created an army of mutant monsters to guard the underground bases from which he now terrorizes mankind. Lulled by hundreds of years of peace, the people of earth are defensless against the minions of DARK. But two brave young men, following an ancient legend of Greek mythology, have devised mechanical wings to bear them aloft in search of DARK's hidden fortress. Armed with the last remaining guns and missiles from a crumbling arsenal, you must fly them across the continents and oceans to seek out and destroy the cruel colossus! If you fail, mankind is lost.

		<Description>Lethal Enforcers is out to clean up the streets in the baddest parts of Chicago. Digitized graphics and sound will slam you into cold reality and heated action. Your job is to defend the innocent and protect yourself from a fatal case of lead poisoning.
Your side iron is packed inside and ready to blow you away with a true arcade experience. Just like the arcade game, you've got the quick reload feature. Time it just right so you don't run out of ammo while you're trading bullets with the scum of the earth. Upgrade your firepower along the way to magnum, 12-round automatic, assault rifle, shot gun, machine gun or grenade gun.
Your type of street cleaning takes place where the dirtiest deeds go down. But first, a training level lets you take target practice and take out your frustrations, then on to reality. Be on the lookout for bank job in progress, high speed chase, ninjas downtown, hijacking at the international airport, gunrunners at the shipping dock, helicopter chase, chemical plant sabotage with volatile Heat of the Night Vision. The pressure under fire is so intense you'll be sweating bullets. Start shooting in any stage you select. At the end of each level, you'll get your hit percentage and your performance rank, from petrolman to commander.</Description>

Throw out the accuracy scores - the goal here is to survive! If you hit an opponent with a grazing shot, you'll have to shoot again quick to put 'em out of commission before they retaliate. When the dust settles and the tumbleweeds roll by, only the most skilled Gun Fighters will be left standing.</Description>

		<Description>You've saved the innocent people of Gradius from the vile Bacterions. But now an even deadlier plague has slimed into the neighborhood. It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you!</Description>

		<Description>Check him out... Mario rips towards you. Check him into the glass. Nab the puck. Pass to an open winger for the give-&amp;-go. Then break free at mid-ice to connect. And slam home a 90mph slapshot. It's life-sized, gut-tightening action. He steals the puck, turns it up ice. You unload a body-crushing check. He drops his gloves... It's a fight! A jab. An uppercut. A roundhouse. And there's the whistle! Lose, and you chill out in the penalty box.</Description>

		<Description>At first, it looked like just another revolution. But reports have come in that the rebel forces are backed by an unusual array of high-tech weaponry - and that the rebel soldiers may actually be a fearsome new breed of fighting robots! If this revolution succeeds, the safety of the entire world may be threatened... And that's where you come in. You must attempt to infiltrate the island base of the rebel forces. But before you even reach the shore, you'll have to contend with enemy gunboats, frogmen, choppers, and destroyers. If you make it to the island, you'll find it patrolled by enemy soldiers armed with machine guns, daggers and grenades; vicious attack dogs; and lethal airborne probes, programmed to destroy intruders on sight. Other unknown dangers lie in wait as well. But if you manage to reach the rebel headquarters, you will face the most terrifying threat of all - only no one has made it back to reveal its nature! You'll be equipped with a complete arsenal - an assault gun, rocket launcher and grenades - to provide you with a fully mechanized system of attack. You haven't got a minute to waste - it's time to launch your MECHANIZED ATTACK!</Description>

		<Description>Players control Marco and Tarma, both members of the special-ops force Team Peregrine Falcon (commonly known as Team PF), and battle their way through stage after stage of intense action. The goal is to try to overthrow General Morden and win back the stolen weapon, the Metal Slug. Players must blast through waves of enemies and machines (while also jumping over any obstacles in the way) to advance through the stages. It's not as hopeless as it might sound, though - weapons such as heavy machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers and flamethrowers, as well as the Metal Slug itself (which appears frequently in the game), will make the battle easier.</Description>

Just like the original Metal Slug, players blaze a trail by shooting and jumping, but Metal Slug 2 adds a new arsenal for you to command, including a heavy machine gun, a shotgun, and even a laser gun, providing players a battle rich with variety to enjoy. Not only that, but battle effects are packed in as well - players turn into mummies after getting caught in poison gas coughed up by mummies. Characters also turn fat, but get an attack-strength upgrade, after picking up too many food items.</Description>

And, oh yes, little inconveniences such as rats the size of cars eager to leave a sharp impression on you. Don't let that stop you. After all, the measure of true success is the amount of obstacles one must overcome. Like hurdles that bring to mind skyscrapers. And big barrels, as in rolling right at your legs. And potholes. Jump on a skateboard and speed over the green slime tiles. Ever wonder what it would feel like to get shot out of a cannon? There're springboards along the course that'll shoot you through mid-air like a surface-to-air missile. Save your breath. There are 24 levels in all and each gets harder and harder as you go along. Metrocross - the fastest, most challenging, most cockamamie course ever conceived by man or beast.</Description>

		<Description>Take control of a red formula car travelling at high speed through the streets, speeding up, jumping, maneuvering to the right and left to avoid the cars obstructing the way and reckless cars coming close to your machine. Be on the lookout for an ambulance suddenly passing by... And keep an eye out for the signposts! Thrill-packed challenges such as the slip zones, dangerous construction sites as well as sharp curves and narrow bay bridges also appear. When in the tunnel, the headlights of your car are the only thing you can rely upon. After improving your skill by going through the beginner's level 1, you can move on to the more difficult high levels 2 and 3.</Description>

		<Description>Infiltrate the criminal underworld - your mission is to seek out and destroy the kingpin of the MR. BIG CORPORATION - if you get that far. You'll have to outwit his enormous army of bodyguards, gangs of charisma-bypass patients in trench coats, the bullet brain with the build of a rhinoceros and the breath of a dung beetle, packs of vicious canine yappies, the psychotic clown with an evil sense of humor - you'll die, but not laughing! The there's the gas-guzzling cadillac jock - a cool specimen, elbow hanging on the door rail, a serious looking piece in his hand and ready to blow you away as he rolls down main street leaving you coughing blood. It's not all bad! You've got a chopper to back you up, a mean, shiny street machine, some heavy metal hardware and some pretty neat moves. And what about the kingpin... did I say he was Mr. Big? No, he's MR. BIG!</Description>

		<Description>The object of this head-to-head puzzle game is to clear your grid of falling patterns called puyos by forming chains of four or more same-colored puyos in a straight line or one of several geometric patterns. What makes this a challenging two-player contest is the fact that when you clear a chain of puyos from your grid, it drops a random piece of filler onto your opponent's grid. The more puyos you clear, the more you fill your opponent's grid, and if you can clutter up his grid enough to fill it to the top, you've won the game.</Description>

		<Description>That's right, folks, the cartoon you know and love is ready to roll again - except this time you get to be Road Runner!
The desert's plenty dangerous all by itself; falling boulders, oncoming trucks, land mines and cannon balls as well as mazes, sand traps and ravines.
Throw in that crafty Wile E. Coyote and you've got one wild-goose chase that's fun, fast and exciting!
He may not be too bright, but he is hungry. And he's got his rocket, jet skates, pogo stick and helicopter.
Better get cookin' before you get cooked.</Description>

		<Description>RollerGames, the 21st Century's most popular thrill sport, is the latest victim of V.I.P.E.R. (Vicious International Punks and Eternal Renegades). With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson "Skeeter" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner. You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles... through dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous landslides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams. It's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball-bearings into bullets!</Description>

In ROLLING THUNDER 2, you'll infiltrate an evil empire that spans the globe from Miami's palm trees to Giza's towering pyramids. Jackhammering machine gun fire forces you to dive for cover through exploding grenades and spent shell casings. Wiping off powder burns, choking on smoky air; it's now or never.

If you're good, you'll pick off the heavily-armed enemy guerillas, one by one, and grab their bazookas and hand grenades. If you're great, you'll turn their weapons against them, to blow away a pack of attack dogs, a fleet of choppers, and a whole battalion of guards. But make one mistake, and it's all over. For you, our POWs... the future of the Free World!</Description>

It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you!</Description>

		<Description>The odds are definitely against them. The enemy's coming by land, by sea, and by air, with an arsenal of every deadly weapon known to man. Tanks. Machine guns. Battleships. And the most villainous army of soldiers this peaceful little land has ever seen. And the defense? Just two lonely skykids in thinly armed, single engine prop bi-planes. They've got guts, but they'll need help from Above to win this battle - a steady hand, lightning reflexes, nerves of steel, and a heart of gold. Do you have what it takes? Then fasten your seat belt and take a deep breath. Because you are their only hope, SkyKid!</Description>

		<Description>In a frantic battle to the checkered flag, Sonic and friends speed around tracks set in medieval castle ramparts, lush rainforests and bustling cities, all taken from the visually rich and varied universes of Sonic and SEGA. Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in Aiai's case -- a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium.</Description>

		<Description>Return of the Jedi picks up the action of the movie where the Rebel forces begin their attack against the Imperial Death Star. In the first level you control Princess Leia on her Speederbike through the forest of Endor, to the safety of the Ewok village. You leave Leia there and go to another part of the forest to control Chewbacca's Scout Walker. There, Han Solo is waiting to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. On the second and third levels you control Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian as he flies the Millenium Falcon. Lando flies close to the Death Star fighting off a mighty attack from TIE Fighters. The Millenium Falcon enters the Death Star and travels down a dangerous corridor towards the central reactor. Blast the reactor and then turn around to get away from the Death Star as it blows up!</Description>

		<Description>You're a brave bounty hunter pursuing outlaw scum like Simon Greedwell, Paco Loco, and Chief Scalpen. Each bad guy has a big reward on his head. And they're helped by hordes of bandits, gunslingers and horse thieves, so pack loads of lead. Track those rotten skunks through an Indian village, on a steaming locomotive, and down the mean streets of lawless Reechforem Gulch. Occasionally, dynamite is at your disposal, as well as weapon power-ups. But cattle stampedes and sneaky traps could end your adventure in a cloud of dust. Oh, and be sure to carry ointment for your saddle sores because you'll ride horseback in a galloping bonus stage filled with handy items. Ultimately, you must make villainous Sir Richard Rose eat sagebrush. Do so and you'll have lots of money and the townsfolk kissing your boots.</Description>

		<Description>You're a helicopter gunship pilot on a daring and dangerous mission: air surveillance of enemy territory. Success depends on how far you can penetrate enemy airspace. Can you handle the pressure? Because the further you go, the more difficult the mission becomes. Show that you've got what it takes by maneuvering your chopper around craggy mountain peaks, through deep dark tunnels, and over tall city buildings. All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!</Description>

		<Description>After losing a confrontation against Super Commandos Mad Dog and Scorpion, the juices of destruction drip from the spiked tongue of the vile alien warmonger - Red Falcon. Now, he's coming back stronger than ever, with a sinister plan that includes having his intergalactic warriors seep into the brains of the U.S. Army. To support his disguised forces of doom, he's recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He's also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth's only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster. And if your spread guns, lasers, flame throwers and mega shells fail to destroy Red Falcon's eight levels of terror, including radioactive lava fields, it's all over but for the shouting, the screaming and the cries from a disintegrating world!</Description>

		<Description>Sunday evening. You're sitting around the sewer watching your main reported, April O'Neil do a live remote from the Statue of Liberty. Then it happens. A humungoso flying android screams out of the sky and rips Lady Liberty from her foundation, sending hundreds of freaked out tourists into the harbor below. "No way!" cries Raphael. "Way," replies Donatello. And the crazy quantum chase is on! Journey through multiple levels of enormous graphics, the largest and craziest talking Turtles ever with eons of bodacious battlegrounds, from prehistoric to futuristic galaxies. Get ready for the 3-D jab and toss that sends enemies flying right in your face. Mondo body slams and pizza power bonuses make you more Turtle than ever before. You better believe you're going to need it. Shredder's out for Turtle hide. And he's got all the time in the world to get it.</Description>

The game offers two-on-two tag-team matches for up to four players, but it also includes single-player one-on-one, time attack, and survival modes. You can even play Tekken Bowling, a minigame in which the fighters use only a ball to strike down Heihachi-headed pins. Although based on the arcade game, the console version of Tekken Tag Tournament features revamped graphics, more moves, and new modes.</Description>

These alien artifacts are tunnel-like tubes, through which the hostile forces of another galaxy threaten to pour, destroying all before them. The combined resources of seven planets have built a single craft capable of carrying one man on a desperate mission to stop the building of alien tubes, sealing the aliens in their own universe forever. The mission is to fly the craft round the rim of the tubes, clearing each wave of aggressors until the pilot can blast his ship down the tube to the next section.

		<Description>It's batter-up and time for Tommy Lasorda's version of Pro-Ball. Whether you're infield or outfield, at the plate or on the mound, stealing bases or catching fly-balls, the competition is hot and you're even hotter now that you're playing with a big leaguer like Lasorda. And you've got control. Curve balls, fastballs or sliders are some of the wind-ups you'll pitch to outwit your batter. But be prepared when he connects, you'll have to think fast to make your players perform like a well-oiled machine. Are you up for a single, double, or even triple play? It all depends on how you throw the ball. But don't worry, you'll get your chance at bat. This is a race for the Pennant, so you better hope Tommy's on your side. Now take your pick, choose your line-up and let's play ball!</Description>

		<Description>Arm yourself! The 20-year wait is over as the first true sequel to the classic 1988 Nintendo Entertainment System original, Bionic Commando, sees the return of the bionically-enhanced Nathan "Rad" Spencer. Time has not been kind to Spencer. Ten years after his heroic defeat of the Imperials, he is betrayed by the government, and sentenced to death for crimes he didn't commit.

But then, terrorists detonate a massive experimental weapon in Ascension City, unleashing an intense earthquake that turns the city into rubble, wipes out the population, and results in the city's air defense grid in the control of a massive terrorist force. There is only one option left, a behind-the-lines assault by a Bionic Commando.</Description>

		<Description>This ain't no 20-minute workout. It's the ultimate in head-to-head competition, in 8 grueling events. 100 meter dash. Long jump. Hurdles. Javelin. Skeet shooting. Triple jump. Archery. And the high jump. No timeouts, no breathers, no water boys. Just you and your own exhaustion. So get psyched. Pick your level of competition and the opening event. Then block out the roar of the crowd and take a deep breath. Because it's not whether you win or lose. It's whether you survive!</Description>

Your friends and neighbors lived in peace. Until the Rogue gang got too big for their britches. You chilled, hoping things wouldn't get too rough. No such luck. They've taken your girlfriend Maria, and there's only one thing you can do... get her back... anyway you can! You have fists of steel! Legs like pistons! And courage that just won't quit! You will need all three because the Rogues are waiting with knives, guns and a whole bunch of nasty punks. And you'll have to fight fast. If the Rogues make it back to their headquarters before you rescue Maria, all hope will be lost. But catch them first and you'll fight the leader of the Rogues. Win Maria... and your turf... will remain safe. Feel any pressure? No way. You're the Vigilante!</Description>

El Blaze is a Mexican fighting champion who defeats opponents with his quick Lucha Libre fighting style. Eileen, originally from China, uses a Monkey Kung-Fu fighting style that she learned from her grandfather, a former Kung-Fu master. Players are able to customize their characters by selecting from four uniquely patterned costumes and a wide range of attachable items that can be placed onto each fighter’s various body parts. Virtua Fighter 5 delivers fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action as players head into battle, taking on a host of popular characters. Players not only achieve victory by defeating highly-skilled opponents, but also by competing for prizes which earn them in-game money allowing them to buy many items at in-game shop. These items allow players to customize their ultimate warrior and become the top Virtua Fighter. In addition, the game introduces "Offensive Move", a new maneuver that allows players to easily approach opponents from the side, adding a more strategic element to the battle.</Description>

		<Description>Are you tough enough to take on the baddest guys on the block?

Think you're tough, huh? Well, you better be. Because you've got to be quick on your feet and fast with your hands to become the next URBAN CHAMPION. You've got to block, fake and land punches that will knock your opponent off the screen. Do that three times and there will be a confetti celebration in your honor as you become the new URBAN CHAMPION. But watch out. Just when you think you've beat him to the punch, you fall into an open manhole! Or get hit by a falling flower pot! Think you can handle the action? Then prove it. Play it by yourself or challenge a friend, either way you'll have a knockout time defeating the toughest guys in the neighborhood in URBAN CHAMPION.</Description>

		<Description>World Heroes 2 Jet, initially released in 1994, is the 3rd in the prolific fighting game series. Choose from 16 historical or well-known heroes, villains and fighters and battle your way to the top to become the world's greatest warrior! There are two types of modes in this version, "Tournament of Titans Mode", where you fight three bouts in one day, and if you are successful you move on to the next day, and "World Heroes Training Mode", where you can fight with any opponent. Furthermore, the addition of dash and back step, which were not in the previous version, as well as a countering system that ushers in a more speedy way of fighting, makes World Heroes 2 Jet even more enjoyable to play. There are also four competition types to choose from, allowing for even more in-depth battles.</Description>

		<Description>This is the fourth installment in the World Heroes fighting game series, released in 1995. In this game, 16 figures from across history fight for the title of the world's strongest. In previous installments, the amount of time you held a button down determined the strength or weakness of an attack, but that system has been removed in this game. In addition to a more orthodox fighting-game approach that enables weak, middle and strong attacks using different buttons, this game includes new elements such as the Hero Gauge, Extra Attacks and Guard Breaker Attacks, adding an exciting new layer of strategy.</Description>
