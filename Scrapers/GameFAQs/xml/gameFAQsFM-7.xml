		<Description>A multiple-character role playing game, PHANTASIE transports you to the medieval Isle of Gelnor for the adventure of your dreams. You command a group of one to six characters with such roles as monk, priest, wizard, ranger, thief or fighter. Your companions need not be human: they may be gnomes, elves, orcs or lizard men - just to name a few of the exotic races. With this motley crew, you search the lands for the Nine Rings to help you wipe out the scourge of Gelnor - the Dark Lord and his evil minions. You'll map out new terrain, explore maze-like dungeons, solve puzzles, learn spells, gain experience and battle countless monsters. In every town you visit you can recruit new members to replace lost or unneeded comrades. Beautiful Hi-Res color graphics and a spellbinding storyline suspend reality and launch you into our magical world. No computer-carrying adventurer will want to miss out on the glorious excitement and enchanting experience that is PHANTASIE!</Description>

		<Description>Your quest to remove the evil warlock's curse will be no easy task since there are precious few clues. All you know is that locating the orb requires a danger-filled search of a vast wilderness and of dungeons, a trip to the Astral Plane and the Netherworld - wherever they are. You command a band of one to six adventurers, each endowed with the skills of a monk, priest, wizard, ranger, thief or fighter. During this quest you'll help your heroes gather treasure, solve puzzles, learn spells, and battle the Dark Lord's countless hordes. With all these magical distractions and obstructions, don't forget that finding the orb will do you no good. You'll still have to find a way to destroy it!</Description>

		<Description>Upon escaping the crumbling ruins of Shadowguard, the black fortress of Minax, you lay your weary body on the now-sacred ground. As you rest, you remember your first encounter with the evil wizard of Mondain, whom you later tracked down and destroyed. The existence of his apprentice, Minax, was soon revealed and the crusade was begun again. Younger and more cunning than her mentor, she has been much more difficult to vanquish. But now your sense of accomplishment is touched by a chilling fear. Have all vestiges of evil been removed? Somehow, you sense that your treacherous foes have not been eliminated. Without further feats of skill, daring and perseverance, all of your past accomplishments may be lost. You stand up, prepare your armor, and walk to the dimension door. Stepping in, the hunt resumes.</Description>
