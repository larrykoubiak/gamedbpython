		<Description>This suite of SIX expertly designed games will give fun and motivation to all children. It is an invaluable aid to learning, revision and reinforcement of many of the facts needed for National Curriculum Key Stages. As children play the games, their progress is automatically monitored and recorded in 36 specific challenges with no input from parents or teacher. Each challenge has four graded practice levels - each of which is also monitored. With many user-customisable features, this is the package that grows with your child. You can watch the children learn, join in the fun or leave them and return later to check progress. You're in control!</Description>

		<Description>You can design a car, house, aeroplane (or whatever you want!) and then walk around it. See what it looks like from any angle. Change it. Add color, detail, animation. The possibilities are endless. And it's ideal for creating games. If you're not artistic, don't worry - there are lots of objects already included in the kit for you to use in your plans, but it's simple to create your own if you want. So, if you enjoy playing games, but want to use your computer's real capabilities for a change, this is a perfect opportunity.</Description>

		<Description>Cities all over the world are masses of idling, polluting, honking cars. We need mass transit - but local, state and national governments haven't been able to make it work. If you can create and operate a successful privately held mass transit operation, you'll do the world a service and reap huge financial rewards - but that's only the beginning... First, manage your railroad - transport passengers and freight, extend your lines, and develop the most efficient and profitable routes and schedules. Then, borrow from the bank, buy and develop land, expand your holdings into hotels, factories, resorts and department stores, play the stock market, and build a financial empire!</Description>

		<Description>Welcome to Abandoned Places - the first of a new series of Role Playing games set in the mythical land of Kalynthia. You must control the lives of the four heroes selected to fight the evil threatening Kalynthia as they emerge from the rock that has been their prison for 900 years. Your quest starts beneath the temple of Heaven's light and your first task will be to escape back to the surface of the land, hopefully arming yourself on the way. Once in the outside world the decision of where to go next is entirely yours. You have a whole world to explore including mountains,  deserts, oceans and of course, cities. We suggest that the first thing you do is to take a boat to the mainland and try to find someone in the cities who can help you decide the direction your fate will take you.</Description>

		<Description>Four hundred years ago, to the day, the four heroes Kalynthia defeated and destroyed Bronagh the prince of Evil. Pendugmahle, the mighty creator of Bronagh, has returned to take his revenge upon Kalynthia and its peoples for the death of his protege. The direct descendants of Dowegen and the leaders of the ancients knew that the only hope for the kingdom of Kalynthia was the return of the ancient heroes. After much effort and persuasion the Order of Arbitrion was reconvened in an attempt to recall the Sword of Life. From the corners of a dank cellar, a few pairs of dark red glistening eyes made up the audience to the few who gathered to form the conjurers circle. A deep glow began form the centre of the circle, which soon became a brilliant ball of light from which the great Sword suddenly burst forth. The ancient order had been drained of life and it has been left up to you to use the sword to choose the heroes which you must lead to defeat Pendugmalhe and his minions.</Description>

		<Description>World leaders gathered together to discuss ways in which to prevent Earth from being destroyed by the effects of heavy pollution. An organization was formed (EGB-5) which launched a Research &amp; Development station into space. The complex was equipped with the best technology and personnel available. The complex hides a sinister secret in that EGB-5 has struck up a deal with aliens: the aliens provide their advanced knowledge and in return EGB-5 help them obtain samples from Earth - plants, animals, humans - covering up for them when necessary. The deal was an amicable one until EGB-5 discovered the aliens had a secret project: the construction of a cyborg which will be cloned, sent to Earth and used to wipe out the current occupants enabling the aliens to settle there. EGB-5 agree the alien base must be destroyed, but face a problem in that they don't know how to access it. They decide the only solution is to set up a suitable person as an abductee in the hope that when they discover what is going on they will do something about it. They choose Travis Connor: Head of R&amp;D at Sin-Tech, Earth!</Description>

		<Description>You scream off the carrier, there's no time to think! You're caught in a swarm of enemy aircraft and more are dead ahead. They're closing at Mach 5, as your machine guns start blasting. Burn through a sky of flying metal! Radar-lock on the frontal attackers and respond with missiles. Your enemies are specks on the horizon, then instantly they're in your face, launching even faster missiles! Nothing can prepare you for the incredible speed of the attack. Hit your afterburner! Dive and twist! Throw your plane into a 360 roll as the enemy spins by so close you almost touch wing tips. Day or night, dog fight or missile duel - the terrifying speed of battle never lets up. The sky shrieks with metal menace. The intercept officer is screaming "Look out!"</Description>

		<Description>Air Bucks is your chance to build an airline - it won't be easy, but if you make it the rewards are huge! You start off with $100,000 and a Dakota (DC3) plane - in 1946, at the start of the air travel boom. You must decide which places to fly to, where to use as a hub, when to buy new planes - and which ones to buy, with what quantity of first class, economy or cargo. New planes become available over time, from a DC9 to the Jumbo - and even the Concorde! But beware - just because a plane is new does not mean it is the best for you - you must decide. You must also find the cash to pay for it; and planes don't come cheap! You are sure to need the help of your friendly bank sooner or later, or even to sell shares!</Description>

		<Description>Sinbad Junior works for the "fair and just" Caliph as an apprentice gardener tending to his incredibly excessive palace gardens. Today however he gazes upon another beautiful flower - the Princess Laila as she stands on a balcony high above the gardens.
Away in an eerie floating castle dark deeds are at hand. The evil Vizier, in his dastardly plan to rule the kingdom, has despatched a demon from the nether regions of hell to kidnap the princess and cast a mighty spell over the kingdom.
As Sinbad stares up at the balcony a dark shape descends from the sky, mauling and clawing at Laila.
Laila screams and the demon lifts off clutching the beautiful princess. Sinbad makes a desperate leap to grab the claw of the monster, but is left on the balcony flat on his back. As the demon disappears into the clouds Sinbad is surrounded by the Caliph's guards and hurled into prison on a charge of sorcery. Now, taking on the role of Sinbad Junior, you not only have to escape the palace dungeons, but also rescure Laila from the evil Vizier.</Description>

		<Description>Armageddon Man casts you as the Supreme Commander of a future barely balanced Earth. The Earth has been split into 16 separate nuclear capable countries, such as the Black African Republic, Japan and European Unite, and it's your job to make sure it doesn't become lifeless.

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</Description>

		<Description>Poor old Getafix, the old druid, has been hit on the head by an enchanted stone and can now no longer remember the formula for the magic potion which will give the Gauls back their superhuman strength. You, Asterix, have to find the magic formula by looking for the ingredients, which are hidden in a forest infested with wild boar and in a fearful Roman encampment. Throughout the game you have to try all the different possible combinations of ingredients until you find the magic potion. The results are often quite unexpected. Action and strategy combine to form an explosive cocktail in this great game, which is inspired by the film "The Enchanted Stone".</Description>

		<Description>It has been more than 40 years since the first nuclear bomb exploded. In that time, the shape of the world has changed dramatically. The power to destroy civilization rests in the hands of the superpowers and now, as either the President of the U.S. or as the General Secretary of the U.S.S.R., you have total responsibility for your nation's course. To succeed, you must enhance your country's prestige without infringing too much on your adversary's interests. If you play the isolationist, you will find yourself alone in a world dominated by your opponent. If you are too aggressive, you could unleash the war that annihilates humankind - and both sides lose. Balance of Power uses a huge statistical database, a meticulously detailed display of the world, and advanced artificial intelligence techniques to put you in command of one of the world's superpowers.

		<Description>Sick of silly old soccer? Tired of pathetic pinball? Then you need a dose of Ballistix - the fastest, wackiest, toughest ball game yet to appear on a computer. Ballistix just explodes with excitement, puzzles and an amazing 130 different screens of frenetic action! The aim of the game is simple: score more goals than your opponent to win the match. Doing it is a different matter as splitters fill the screen with dozens of balls, tunnels hide them from view, bumpers bounce balls all over the show, fiendish red arrows speed them up to almost impossible velocity, magnets pull them away from your control, and much, much more. You can play against the computer or another player, set the speed if you can't stand the pace, define where the balls are fired and their velocity, rack up bonuses that will get you extra goals and then, at the end of an exhausting game, set your name in pride of place on the high-score table.</Description>

		<Description>The Penguin is back and he's set himself up as a respectable umbrella merchant. Or has he? Could the umbrella factory be just a cover for his plot to take over the world with an army of robotic penguins? As Batman you must match clues you've collected to locate the master computer and - POW! ZAP! CRUNCH! - put an end to the demented squawkings of that overweight birdbrain. But that's not all! As soon as you've taken care of the Penguin, the Joker pulls off his greatest feat of sleight of hand - he kidnaps Robin! At the scene of the crime you must gather all the facts. Then, while the trail is still hot, you're off on a crime-solving adventure. Grab your Batarang and rev up the Batmobile - because if you don't reach Robin in a hurry, the last laugh will be on you! HA! HA! HA! HA!</Description>

		<Description>Hey Dudes! You're going on a most excellent adventure through history. You know the whacked-out, time-warped trip we had in the movie. Now, in the Bill &amp; Ted's Most Excellent computer game, you'll meet some neat dead dudes, too - though you'll need more than two to pass that most heinous history exam!

At the Circle K, meet Rufus, an ultra-cool messenger and his time traveling phone booth. Just dial a year and take off in time. You're looking for a bodacious bunch of historical heavyweights to bring back to San Dimas High. This is an excellent arcade/action adventure, but only the coolest of dudes will be triumphant!

Can you find the answer for Socrates the philoso-fixer, take notes for Beethoven, fiddle with Nero and chill out with Joan of Arc (she's one hot chick, but it's "Miss of Arc" to you)? No way?! Yes, way! Genghis Khan likes Twinkies and Marie Antoinette is into cake, but how do you get Freud to leave his mother and get Mikey (Michaelangelo) off the ceiling? Don't forget that short, dead dude Napoleon, and there's Abe Lincoln and Billy the Kid. Plus, Uncle Al (relativ-ity) wanders randomly - hey, he's Einstein, whatcha gonna do!

The animation and graphics are incredible. There's stuff digitized right outta the movie and some really neat sounds. Whoa! There's even four levels of difficulty to make this totally not easy.

So be excellent to yourself and buy this computer game. Party on, dudes!</Description>

		<Description>Experience life in the fast lane!

Strap yourself into the first stock car race simulation that actually puts you behind the wheel and in complete control. Co-designed by NASCAR star Bill Elliott himself, this test of man and machine duplicates authentic racing from the working instrument gauges to racing strategies like drafting and the sling shot. It's so realistic you'll swear you can smell the infield barbecues!

Slide into the roll cage of one of three ground-pounding 650 horsepower beasts. Then go head-to-head with "Awesome Bill from Dawsonville" and 14 of the nation's most relentless racers in three different skill levels. You'll face them in the Championship Season on the speed scorching banked ovals of Daytona and Talledega and the rubber-ripping corners of Sears Point and Watkins Glen. But test your skill and strategies in practice first. Or else you'll be stripped of your NASCAR license for good (what a disgrace).

But your adversaries are only half the battle. Depending on the type of track, you must decide between manual and automatice transmission, which engine, spoiler angle, gear ratio and tire stagger to use. Choose carefully, or you'll find yourself pacing the pits while your competitors are lapping you up.

You better feel the need for speed to enter the no guts, no glory world of NASCAR racing. Bill Elliott wouldn't steer you wrong, so be careful not to do it yourself!</Description>

		<Description>Meet Terry &amp; Tracy, an everyday pair of walking, talking tomatoes caught up in a totally unfeasible tale of rivaly, evil squirrels and mystical lands... oh and, erm, love!

INGREDIENTS
Tracy and Terry are the cream of the tomatoes. Apart from being particularly ripe and squashy specimens, theyre both in love and determined to escape from the lorry taking them to the Puree factory so they can run away together and get married.

And so, after being hurried in to the back of the delivery truck, they make their move, slipping quietly out of the back and away to happiness. Whatever could go wrong?

Well, as it happens, lurking in the trees along their path, an evil squirrel was eyeing up Tracys plumb form and decided to take her for his own. Just as the two lovebirds were passing by a tall vine, the squirrel struck, whisking Tracy away from Tez and carrying her away to his vine-top abode.

Terry saw red. His skin puckered and his little crown of leaves trembled with anger. So, off he dashed in pursuit of the rascally rodent to win back his sweetheart...

		<Description>For two years, your people have struggled against the relentless onslaught of invading forces. With your army reduced to a handful and your artillery depleted, further resistance seems impossible. But in a hidden underground laboratory, a team of scientists has at last perfected a new kind of fighting machinery: a bionic arm that extends and contracts, providing unheard of strength and maneuverability. Combined with an arsenal of rapid-fire, armor-piercing and heat-seeking weaponry, this will put the power of an entire army in the hands of one man... one carefully chosen soldier, who has what it takes to become a new breed of unstoppable commando... a Bionic Commando. And you are that soldier! Your mission will take you through the heavily-patrolled wilderness surrounding the enemy headquarters and into the very heart of the fortress itself. Even to the most courageous soldier, it would seem an impossible challenge. But there has never been a soldier like the Bionic Commando!</Description>

It's time for full-speed, high contact hockey, the kind of bone-jarring action played by the pros. The puck is dropped, you take control, center it and... Whoa! Your opponent viciously checks you from behind, making an incredible steal. You charge after him, crushing him against the boards. Suddenly tempers flare, off come the gloves, and you're swinging fists like a prize fighter. What action! You can even rack up assists like the great you-know-who. Or play goalie in the slap shooting penalty scenes. So strap on Blades of Steel. And imagine those immortal words - "He shoots, he scores!"</Description>

		<Description>Sit back and get comfortable before you open this box. You might not be moving from your computer for a while, because once you start in with the 3D blocks, you'll be hooked! You'll begin with the playing pit, a 3D enclosure with length, width and depth that you can set. During the game, various 3D blocks will fall into the pit. Your job is to rotate and maneuver each of them into the proper position in order to form complete layers. As each layer is completed, it vanishes, giving you more points and more room to work. Blockout will challenge your reflexes and your resolve in a test of coordination and quick thinking. But the greatest challenge of all will be keeping yourself from playing it again and again.</Description>

If you've played the others, you know that some have a little of this and some of that - but never everything a real baseball fanatic needs in one cool Game Pak... until now. Because Bo knows exactly what you're looking for in a baseball game. One or two players - head-to-head in exhibition or in a championship league pennant chase. You're on the mound - 15 pitches, pick-offs and bean-balls. You're behind the plate - call for the pitch and gun down base runners. You're in the batter's box - bunt, choke up for contact or just swing for the fences. You're in the field directing all 9 players - run, jump, dive and throw. You're on the basepaths - with complete control of each individual runner to steal at will. Bo Jackson Baseball has the largest players ever seen in a game and the best digitized sounds you'll ever hear!</Description>

		<Description>BOH is a unique retro-flavoured top-down shooter that combines maze exploration and action with terrific results. You move in claustrophobic, traps-packed, mind-boggling battlefields searching for the Evil Masters, who throw countless enemies at you until you discover and face them in the final battle. Although your quests are made slightly less hard by the bonuses and power-ups scattered all around, carrying out the missions demands lots of concentration and quick reflexes. With BOH the fun never ends: new missions can be added anytime and you can even create your own! And, as if that was not enough, you can also customize entirely its audio-visual aspect! BOH has been created with lots of passion and care to offer, with its oldschool style, a fascinatingly different videogaming experience.</Description>

		<Description>Danger in the first degree. Open on a sultry, rather unremarkable big-city afternoon. Focus on a sweaty, sort of sloppy small-time PI's office. The drowsy detective is rudely jerked back to consciousness by his telephone's nasty jangle: "Sam, you're a dead man." Seems things have suddenly gotten very personal. A definitely unsettling how-do-you-do. But who in the world could be the perpetrator? And why? "Sam, you're a dead man." There are 20 serious suspects. And, unfortunately for Sam, it seems each one wants to throw the first clump of dirt on his coffin. "Sam, you're a dead man." A smart gumshoe will turn his old casefiles - and the city - upside down to find the fiend. A smarter gumshoe will also turn and constantly check his flanks. Seems Sam's been put in the rather precarious position of trying to skin a cat without getting skinned alive. "Sam, you're a dead man." And the one man who can help with a few precious clues and tidbits of info just happens to be blind. "Sam, you're a dead man." "Sam, you're a dead man." Guess who's Sam. Have a nice day.</Description>

		<Description>With Buggy Boy, be prepared for the bumpiest ride of your life, over five tough courses where the terrain is littered with boulders, trees, brick walls and fences. Use your skills to jump the obstacles by hitting the logs on the track. This either sends you flying or turns you on two wheels to enable you to steer through narrow gaps. But be careful - time is against you! Each leg must be completed within a given time limit or you will be disqualified. Additional points are scored by collecting flags and driving through the score gates. Collect the flags in the right order and a score bonus is awarded. Full of thrills and spills, Buggy Boy is the ultimate driving challenge!</Description>

		<Description>It's double fun and double trouble all the way in Captain Fizz, the most exciting simultaneous 2-player game you and a friend are ever likely to play. It's a whole new world of high-speed, split-screen action, as both of you take on the nasty Blaster-Trons infesting the planet Icarus. Yup, it's a tough mission all right, but you might just win out with the right blend of cooperation, courage, laser-hot reflexes, tactical sense and brains. There are 22 levels of savage and relentless action to battle through before you reach your objective, the central computer that's causing the evil infestation. You'll never get there, though, unless you put your heads together and cooperate; your buddy can't do it on his own and neither can you. This is one program where even the easy games are hard. So remember - united you stand, but divided you fall...</Description>

		<Description>Championship Baseball has it all. You begin by drafting a team. Look over the talent pool. You'll need starting pitchers, relievers, infielders, outfielders, even utility players for bench strength. Consider each player's talents carefully before putting them on your team. Once you've selected your team, set your batting order. Then choose which of the four divisions suits you, and play ball! Championship Baseball gives you more options. You may want to start with some batting practice to master the fine art of hitting a screwball. Then, challenge a friend or the computer to 9 innings of intense action. When you're ready, pick your team and enter the 4-division, 24-team race for the pennant! You control all the action - pitching, hitting, catching, outfield relays, base running, even sliding under tags. All in the most realistic baseball simulation you can find!</Description>

		<Description>Sometime during the last century, an experimenter with time, space and early computers created a bizarre machine. The inventor's name was Baron Fortesque. The machine was... The Chaos Engine. Although primitive, the machine became incredibly powerful and went crazy, turning ordinary humans and household pets into razor-toothed, armor-plated killing machines. Enter 6 hard-nailed mercenaries for hire. These ball-breakers are armed to the teeth with over 25 weapons and a host of special destructive devices specific to their class. Select 2 characters to form your party and enter the World of Chaos. The sprawling adventure covers 4 graphic worlds and 16 levels loaded with fiendish traps, puzzles and secret passages. Get your hands on sawn-off shotguns, molotov cocktails and a huge amount of armament, and buy, blag or blast your way through hordes of different monsters to do battle with the ultimate killing machine, THE CHAOS ENGINE!</Description>

		<Description>After a great many ups and downs, and a mind-boggling chase in a spatial-temporal universe, you have finally caught up with your father's murderer and you are about to return to the family chateau in 1922. Explora is still there, but does this technological wonder invented by an aged scientist at the very beginning of the twentieth century have enough fuel to bring you back to your origins? Unfortunately, the teleportation phase is disturbed by a major incident - a disorder in the temporal turbines has caused the engine to overheat and to use up too much of the metal essential to fuel the supergenerator. Yet again catapulted into the world of the unknown, you are going to have to use every last bit of intelligence to come out on top in these new trials. Your main preoccupation will be to find the metal so necessary to Explora.</Description>

		<Description>It's an imaginary world that's real. It exists in another dimension, where cartoon characters, called Doodles are alive. It's Cool World.
For cartoonist Jack Deebs, who's been carried across the boundary, it's a wild and amazing place; and he's discovered that only some of the Doodles are friendly. Take Holli Would. She's a knockout Doodle who's really interested in Jack. She's interested in using him to get herself and real body and transfer into this world. She just needs to get her hands on one special piece of magic.
The Golden Spike of Power, hidden atop the Ocean Hotel in Las Vegas, is the powerful wedge between Cool World and this world. And Holli's trying to steal it. If she removes it, she may destroy both her world and Jack's. As Jack, you're got to stop her from doing it -- because you know she will if she can!</Description>

		<Description>You have only a very short time to prove your father innocent of a murder he's been jailed for... or he faces the death sentence! Use his Private Eye's office to run your own investigation. You'll need to hack into his computer files, phone his contacts, talk to some strange people - and do some legwork around town looking for vital clues! All this will take cash - so you'd better strike lucky on the Black Market, or you'll have to borrow from the loanshark. Crime City is a deep game crammed with locations to explore - all beautifully drawn and full of objects to examine and collect and people to speak to (in person and by phone). And beware - the game is also truly interactive: people's attitude towards you depend on your behavior in the game!</Description>

		<Description>After you saved the entire city of Phlan and located the Pool of Radiance, a simple trip to Tilverton should have been as easy as a noon-day stroll. But it wasn't...
Ambushed, captured, and knocked unconscious, you awake with no idea who attacked you or how you arrived in Tilverton. You only know that five azure-blue symbols are imprinted just under the skin of your right arm.
The mystical power of the azure symbols ensnares your will like metal bonds! And when the bonds glow, you must do as they command. No magic dispels the bonds and no cleric's prayers remove them.
Your only hope: search the Forgotten Realms for members of the alliance who created the bonds and regain control of your own destiny. Only then can you be free of the Curse of the Azure Bonds.</Description>

		<Description>Can you survive the haunted house on the hill? From the moment the creaking drawbridge closes behind you until you slay the Black Knight, Dark Castle is a non-stop life and death adventure. Pitting you against the evil that threatens you at every turn, Dark Castle requires that you think quick, act fast and have a real zest for life. Where will your adventure take you? Through dungeons, laboratories and caves. Up and down ladders and ropes. Over trap doors. Past whip-cracking henchmen and Merlin the Magician, all of whom kill first, then ask questions. By creepy crawlers, kamikazee vultures and other mutants of mischief. And the more elusive you are, the more difficult it gets. Dark Castle has you looking over your shoulder as soon as your hunt for the Black Knight begins. Are you a hero? Or are you history?</Description>

		<Description>Darkseed is based upon the fantastic artwork of swiss surrealist H.R. Giger, the inspiration for such blockbusters as Alien, Alien 3 and Poltergeist II. Giger has revolutionised the look of Science Fiction forever with his unique "biomechanical" style which depicts the synthesis of technology and biology as they might evolve without the influence of man.
Challenge your mind... You are Mike Dawson, a Science Fiction writer who just purchased an old victorian house. As you explore your new home, you soon discover that you have bought more than you bargain for.
Control the fate of two worlds... The world as we know it and the dark world of an ancient and dying civilisation. Unlock the secret of a sinister plot and discover the dark passage to their world... A place more terrifying than your darkest nightmare.
Time is running out... You are on a collision course with destiny and only you have the ability to save yourself and the world from a cruel and inhuman fate. Every decision may be your last, so choose wisely... All of humanity is depending on you.</Description>

		<Description>Das Boot puts you in command of a Type VII U-boat - the submarine responsible for millions of tons of Allied shipping losses in WWII. Your boat is complete in every detail: use its torpedos to send Allied ships to the bottom; the 88mm deck gun and 20mm anti-aircraft batteries let you attack targets on the surface and on land, and defend you against enemy aircraft. When the pressure is on and enemy destroyers are zeroing in on you, submerge and vanish - if you can. Listen with your hydrophone, move quietly - or else they'll find you and try to turn you into an oil slick.</Description>

		<Description>Strategy is vital in this chivalrous charade, and smarts will protect your hide better than armor as you command the role of a brave Saxon knight destined to avenge King Richard's murder. To reclaim the crown and conquer the heart of a beautiful maiden, you must outwit and outmaneuver hordes of medieval marauders. Read maps, plan raids, even team with Robin Hood, then plunder enemy strongholds, dueling for gold needed to build an army of mercenary vassals. You'll also need to stash cash for catapults that launch boulders, fire and disease into formidable fortresses. So wise up and rise up to this unique challenge where leadership is as important as swordmanship. For when you've survived this strategic adventure, complete with daring jousts and courageous castle sieges, you won't be sorry - you'll be king!</Description>

Guide your laser beam around each screen. Reflectors, refractors, mirrors, absorbers, polarizers and fiber optics are your basic apparatus. Your precise judgment of the angles and paths of your high-intensity laser are the only means by which your beam can be directed towards the home receiver.

		<Description>You're the only soul in a twilight zone that's like nowhere you've ever been before. It's a space station in the middle of nowhere... an eerie world full of deadly surprises... a time bomb of explosive vapors. And your mission is to find out what makes it tick and avert impending disaster before it's too late. All you've got to do is drill and release the volatile vapors brewing beneath the surface. Sound easy? Not exactly. Because first, you've got to figure out where to drill... There are 18 different sectors to explore and drill in, each with its own unique geography - and rules. Rove across the lifeless space station in your land vehicle, or soar above it all in a plane - if you can only find it. You'll be uncovering the secrets of a complex world where nothing is quite what it seems. And you'll need all the ingenuity you can muster to triumph!</Description>

		<Description>Are you clever enough to solve an evil wizard's twisted puzzles? Do you possess the concentration needed to explore a labyrinth of mystery? Should you resist the tempting treasures, defeat the hideous monsters, and escape the devious traps that are hidden throughout the Grey Lord's dreadful dungeon?
Yes? Then perhaps you'll be the one to enter the caves of the sacred mountain and retrieve the Firestaff from the evil Lord Chaos. To succeed, you must assemble a band of four champions and lead them in fierce battles against the terrible Dark Lord who now rules your master's dungeon.
And if you fail? At best, you'll meet your ghastly end in the dungeon's wretched catacombs, like hundreds of brave adventurers who went before you. Far worse, you might become a captive "trophy" of the evil Lord Chaos, suspended forever in the haunting mirrors of the Hall of Champions.</Description>

		<Description>Bursting with high-speed arcade action, Emlyn Hughes International Soccer offers the most realistic gameplay ever seen on a home computer. You can almost sense the thrill of the crowd as the goalkeeper tips a dipping shot over the bar! Stand back, and for a moment you'll believe that you are watching a real match on TV!  Sophisticated artificial intelligence makes the play incredibly realistic, with diving headers and sliding tackles, even barging, side-stepping and backheels, plus free-kicks, throw-ins, goalkicks, corners and penalties! But that's not all - you can enter your own team of star players, set their skill levels individually, and manage them through the season. The fitness of each player is constantly changing, so you may have the difficult selection problems - do you take a risk and put your ace striker in the team if he isn't fully fit?</Description>

As your empire increases, you will soon have at your command armies, fighters, and a powerful navy. Your navy can be comprised of your choice of aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines and troop transports. However, your aspirations to be emperor are not achieved easily.

		<Description>After a great many ups and downs, and a mind-boggling chase in a spatial-temporal universe, you have finally caught up with your father's murderer and you are about to return to the family chateau in 1922. Explora is still there, but does this technological wonder invented by an aged scientist at the very beginning of the twentieth century have enough fuel to bring you back to your origins? Unfortunately, the teleportation phase is disturbed by a major incident - a disorder in the temporal turbines has caused the engine to overheat and to use up too much of the metal essential to fuel the supergenerator. Yet again catapulted into the world of the unknown, you are going to have to use every last bit of intelligence to come out on top in these new trials. Your main preoccupation will be to find the metal so necessary to Explora.</Description>

		<Description>When you climb into the cockpit of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, get set for the "fight of your life" as the powerful Falcon F-16 takes you streaking across the sky at mach 2. Accurate weapons system, head-up-displays, cockpit controls and overall flight characteristics make this the ultimate in simulations. The enemy MiGs you encounter are very resourceful and skilled. And if that isn't enough, challenge another pilot in the head-to-head option via direct computer link. State of the art 3D graphic images of buildings, forests, freeways, and bridges flash by as you fly at the speed of sound only 150 feet above the deck. Take out bridges, power stations, tanks, airfields and SAM sites. Whether you are a novice pilot or a real "top gun", FALCON is for you!</Description>

		<Description>Get ready for over 100 levels of pulsating action as you take on the powers of your favorite player, even if they're already in play. Watch out for the death curse of the evil "IT" and flee from the thieving grasp of the "THAT" creature. Stun Tiles, Acid Puddles, Force Fields, Super Sorcerers, Phony and Moving Exits make your progress all the more difficult. But there are mystical amulets to be collected which will enhance your powers to repel monsters, transport through walls or increase your firepower. Avoid poisoned food and potions, collecting them makes you dizzy! Gauntlet II is not just a further episode in this enthralling crusade, it is a whole new experience in action-packed adventure!</Description>

		<Description>You're really up against it this time. These revolting robots have finally upped and turned their horribly powerful weapons on their kind human masters. Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand... I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out the mess? You guessed - you get the job. Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment and time is running out.</Description>

		<Description>Become Genghis Khan and lead the most fearsome army in the known world. Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</Description>

You haven't really experienced football until you've been down on the field, with an outside linebacker headed straight for you and nobody blocking him. There's a word for that experience - the word is pain. You haven't felt the real excitement of football until you've run the perfect pass pattern, broken free near the end zone, and caught the winning touchdown pass. There's a reward for that kind of performance - the reward is victory! You haven't seen real computer football until you've seen GFL Championship Football. It has what no other computer football program has: in-the-helmet perspective to put you down on the field, where the action is! Which is where you want to be if you're looking for real football.

Thrown into this mayhem, is the courageous Sir Arthur. A victorious knight with the awesome task of penetrating the Demon's Castle to pulverize the Prince of Darkness. Can he do it? It's up to you. You'll dangerously travel through the Place of Execution, the Village of Decay, the Town of Fire, and the Crystal Forest with an arsenal of weapons at your side. And when you're really down on your luck, magic fights might with powerful results. The only problem? You'll have to learn how to use it. And avoid it.

		<Description>HAIL SPARTACUS, the ultimate gladiator! Taken into slavery as a child, his parents slaughtered by the Romans, Spartacus was destined to become one of the most famous heroes of all time. He was trained to fight in the arena, spending many years perfecting his skills with the sword, shield and spear. Time could not tame him. Spartacus never forgot the freedom of his past, or the cruel ways of the Roman Empire. When the time came to be called to the arena, Spartacus knew this was his chance for revenge. If he could beat the Emperor's finest gladiators, he could overpower the guard at the gate and make his bid for freedom.</Description>

		<Description>Armageddon Man casts you as the Supreme Commander of a future barely balanced Earth. The Earth has been split into 16 separate nuclear capable countries, such as the Black African Republic, Japan and European Unite, and it's your job to make sure it doesn't become lifeless.

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</Description>

		<Description>My Story..... Fifty years ago, my Grandfather, a brave and bold warrior, defeated a powerful force of space pirates to secure a new world for the human race, who were fleeing from the now dead Earth. The past five decades of life on the Ring-Worlds of Triton have altered the life of the Human Race. Man is no longer a warrior; his technological advancement has bred a new fighter. Robot pilots now defend his new home. With no concept of fear and reactions a little slower than the speed of light, they are the formidable force which has prevented reprisals from the pirates; until now.
In a daring and swift surprise raid, most of these robot pilots were captured by the pirates, and are now being held on the 16 disused space research platforms on which they were forced to take refuge. The pirates are probably planning an attack on the Ring-Worlds which, now undefended, will undoubtedly fall; especially it our own robots are used against us. It is imperative that these robots are returned, or at least destroyed, otherwise the Human race will come to an end.
As the decendent of The Goldrunner; now a legendary hero, I am the only one who can take on the near impossible task of flying a single seater fighter to the platforms, surviving the pirates own substantial cyborg defence system completely unaided, and recovering as many robots as I can. Even with the latest Goldrunner II fighter this will be an extremely difficult mission, and I can only be expected to do my best. However; I must bear in mind that if my best is not good enough, the human race will die.</Description>

		<Description>Formula One racing is recreated in detail in this simulation. You can drive a McLaren, Ferrari or Williams car, each with different qualities, around the real-life Formula One circuits including Monaco, Suzuka and the original Hockenheim circuit characterized by long straights. Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1.</Description>

		<Description>In 2320, interstellar travel has become as commonplace as intercity, and man's mission to colonize the universe is well underway. But then the Outies appeared. No one knew where they came from, but it was obvious what they were after... energy - and they'd stop at nothing to get it! They favor charged Black Holes. And they just turned your latest colony into one. But this galaxy's not big enough for the both of you. Consult your 3D Holotank before entering the scrolling isometric view of Einstein-Minkowski Four Space. Explore. Terraform. Colonize. Erradicate. Construct. But above all: survive!</Description>

		<Description>Why buy this game when you could steal it? Except you can't. Not yet. An amateur like you? Come off it! Now, if you were a fully paid-up member of the notorious Guild of Thieves, things would be different. Mind you, it's not easy. You might find yourself ditched on a remote jetty by the Guildmaster. You might find that the Guild expects you to ransack a well guarded mansion. To go grave robbing. Potholing. Or maybe - if they're really doubtful of your abilities - everything at once! No problem, really, in a country full of helpful natives and friendly wildlife. Trouble is, you're not in a country like that. You're in Kerovnia. If you've played The Pawn, you'll remember Kerovnia. Except that the place seems to have gone downhill since then. But you'll find that out for yourself soon enough. And just one final hint - don't try any funny stuff. The Guildmaster has seen it all before. So has the Gatekeeper. So has the... But why should we give you any hints?</Description>

The Russians have in their possession a notebook known only as The Doomsday Papers. With it, they can bring the world to its knees.
Using your special investigative prowess, you must break into a place that is not exactly a tourist attraction. It's a maximum security complex located somewhere in Siberia. The good news is that you won't need a passport. The Bureau is lending you their satellite so you can get into the complex with your computer. They've even managed to infiltrate the building with a few droids called Mobile Remote Units (MRUs)
It seems easy enough, once you penetrate the security. Just move the MRUs from room to room. Locate the combinations to the safe. Find the safe. And remove the documents. But it's not that easy. In face, it's downright dangerous. There are video cameras and monitors to be avoided. Guard patrols. And something called... the annihilator. Plus, the only map is the one you've got to make while not being discovered by all of the above. That's why the government wants you. Your reputation got you into this mess. Your skill will have to get you out. There meter is running.</Description>

		<Description>Strike Force Harrier puts you in the cockpit for a full flight and combat simulation of one of Britain's most exciting fighter aircraft. Your objective is to bomb the enemy HQ, at the same time defending yourself and your ground sites from enemy aircraft and ground forces. You have cannon, bombs, and Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles at your disposal - but the enemy is just as well-armed as you are. You can select either practice or combat level, with a skill level of pilot, commander or ace. At the end of each mission your score is given, calculated on the basis of your distance from the enemy HQ.</Description>

		<Description>Depending on your skill, confidence and courage, you have the choice of remaining near the landing pad, learning to hover and land, or venturing higher to practice your approaches. When you think you have mastered these, then accelerate the Jump Jet into an attack fighter. Use the radar and range finder to seek and destroy the enemy by launching heat-seeking, air-to-air missiles. Beware! His radar and missile systems are as good as yours. Reckless pursuit is ill-advised; you must maintain a fuel level that will enable you to relocate and return to the aircraft carrier, executing the skills you have learned to achieve a successful landing.</Description>

As time passed the Gods lost interest in their creations and visits across the Rainbow Bridge ceased. Frey, one of the oldest and wisest Gods, foresaw that they would one day have need of the Vikings so he visited the leader and told him that in centuries time a great warrior would be born amongst them to lead his people in a mission of great importance, representing the Vikings at the Battle of Ragnarok. The warrior that legend speaks of will be known as... HEIMDALL. Follow Heimdall through his growth from small boy to manhood in this true RPG.</Description>

		<Description>The good Queen Xeldeth 1 has commissioned you to command HMS Raider, an interstellar sloop, on a daring privateer raid deep into the extremities of the Thraxish Empire. On a planet aptly named Hell, because of its searingly hot atmosphere, you discover the secret of the Thraxish treasure houses: Hell's volcanoes periodically spew forth vast quantities of massive gem stones, each bigger than a Zullet's egg. You take your ship in successive collection runs, using your orbital fighters to defend the Raider against furious attacks by the Imperial Fighter Force. As the holds of the Raider are filled, each cargo of riches must be transported off Hell, but beware, this annoys the Thraxons who become increasingly protective of their home-grown treasure.</Description>

Then take on HOT ROD and race through 30 turbulent tracks, encountering the meanest conditions, such as rain, snowdrifts and ice - then tackle the challenge of murderous rock slides and slippery sand. Tight corners abound with moving police cars and construction crews to hinder your way, testing your driving skills and stamina to the end. Win the races and buy extra parts from the race track garage - bigger engines, snow tires, bumpers and wings - then it's back to the starting line for more hot action!</Description>

They blackmail him into stealing priceless works by Leonardo da Vinci from a heavily guarded auction house and from the Vatican itself! The job has Hawk dodging bullets and guard dogs, thwarting sophisticated security systems, dangling from rooftops and crawling through booby-trapped ventilation shafts. And if Hawk makes it out alive? Well maybe he can turn the tables on his blackmailers. Because they aren't just art collectors, they have a plot to rule the world! But if Hawk can break into their lair, he just might be able to steal the one object that can stop them. The Hudson Hawk? Saving the world? It's a dirty job, but hey, somebody's got to do it!</Description>

		<Description>"Just what the heck are HUMANS?... and what are they doing in a video game anyhow?" We know... we've heard it before, they're strange... they're ugly... they're stupid. But there's more to these HUMANS than meets the eye, for inside each and every one of them is a small but usable brain. Working as a team and discovering new tools is the key to survival in this cruel world of chaos and carnivores. It's an action-filled race against time, where you score points by finishing levels with as many of your tribesmen intact as HUMAN-ly possible (which isn't that easy when it comes down to survival of the fittest). With Gametek's Sega Genesis version of HUMANS, the only missing link is you!</Description>

		<Description>Just when a man thinks his luck is running out, things start getting even worse. He gets run over by a bus. Sprayed with cheese sandwich by a supernatural being. Smashed against a tunnel by a speeding train. He gets incinerated, widdled on, folded, bent, spindled, mutilated and generally mucked about with. And in return? He gets the leading role in a perplexing, hilarious race against time and chance, set in a jinxed land menaced by the impending death of good fortune. Look on the bright side - it could be your luckiest move yet. Don't expect tiresome trolls, obvious orcs, silly spells and wet, wimpish witches in JINXTER. Infuriating, enchanting, absurd and hilarious by turns, JINXTER will surprise you with every move you make. But don't forget: every silver lining has a cloud.</Description>

		<Description>If you've ever been spellbound by a fantasy story, captivated by a role playing game, or enthralled by interactive fiction, Journey will rouse your imagination to new heights.
Join us in our Journey. Travel beyond the known boundaries of interactive software into a new world of computer storytelling, Marc Blank - the pioneering co-author of the enormously popular Zork and Enchanter trilogies - weaves a fabulous tale of great adventure, drawing from the highest art of storytelling and the excitement of role playing games to create a fascinating new kind of computer entertainment.
In Journey, you become part of a mesmerizing epic created in the tradition of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. For five long years, failed crops, tainted water, and sickness have blighted a peaceful land. Brave villagers have set forth to find relief for their suffering region, but none have returned. Now, you another small band is preparing to begin the odyssey. You'll share the adventures of Tag, Praxix, Bergon, Esher, and Minar as they solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, explore unknown lands.
Pass into the world of Journay with easy. The game is simple to learn: your challenge lies in choosing the right path, casting the best spell, and knowing whether to lie or tell the truth. You imagination will be taxed more and more with each passing day as the difficulties become increasignly complex.
As the tale unfolds, you become acquainted with the characters and their personalities. Each character acts on his own, sometimes advancing the quest, sometimes hindering it. You help them decide where to explore and what actions to take, taking part in their strategies and problem-solving.
The intrigue of a masterfully told story. The thrill of being a part of a great adventure. The challenge of leading the tale to its climactic conclusion. This is what makes Journey a uniquely compelling entertainment.</Description>

		<Description>Depending on your skill, confidence and courage, you have the choice of remaining near the landing pad, learning to hover and land, or venturing higher to practice your approaches. When you think you have mastered these, then accelerate the Jump Jet into an attack fighter. Use the radar and range finder to seek and destroy the enemy by launching heat-seeking, air-to-air missiles. Beware! His radar and missile systems are as good as yours. Reckless pursuit is ill-advised; you must maintain a fuel level that will enable you to relocate and return to the aircraft carrier, executing the skills you have learned to achieve a successful landing.</Description>

		<Description>Be prepared for a spectacular adventure; three times larger than any previous Sierra adventure, a landmark in computer gaming that transcends existing standards of computer graphics, sound and animation.
Powerfully dramatic, King's Quest IV evokes emotion like no other computer game with a unique combination of lifelike animated personalities, beautiful landscapes, and soul-stirring music. Sierra has recreated the universe of King's Quest, a world that one moment will pull at your heartstrings, the next moment place terror in your heart. Uniting the best programmers, artists, and musicians in the business, Sierra has created a constantly evolving universe where landscapes change from day to night, characters roam freely, and dramatic music interhides tantalize your emotions in a complicated tale of faith and mistrust. Your quest begins with a full-length cartoon and proceeds to plunge you into a fantasy world of mystery, intrigue and enough plot twists to confound even the most dedicated adventurer.
Embark upon a perilous journey into the darkest corners of the King's Quest universe. Not one, but many successful quests must be completed to save the royal family from strategy destiny. With a surprise introduction and an equally unexpected conclusion, plot twists abound as you strive to discover the mysteries of a strange land, overcome its hostile inhabitants, and reveal the secrets hidden therein.
Roam the grounds at night and discover areas which remain hidden during daylight hours. Travel swiftly, as time is of the essence, and each moment brings the royal family closer to ruin.</Description>

		<Description>The chronicles of Anar have long told the legend of a mystical sword, and its accompanying shield whose magical aura protected the inhabitants of Anar for many centuries. The sword and shield were supposedly guarded by the ancient Corsarians, but their existence, and possible whereabouts are now purely part of folklore. The evil wizard Suzar has assembled a fighting force of mutated humanoids, and plunged the kingdom into a state of fear. An entire army of brave warriors has already perished at the hands of the wicked wizard, and only with the combined powers of the legendary sword and shield is it possible to defeat the dark forces that are suffocating the land. Having been summoned before King Darius and the High Council of Anar, you and five other loyal men volunteer to find the enchanted sword and shield, and destroy Suzar before he is able to amass an army large enough to enslave Anar, and the rest of the world... and so you come to team up with a motley band of hardened adventurers on your quest to seek out the sword and shield, as the chronicles have foretold.</Description>

		<Description>You know what it's all about. That's right. The crazy cop and his almost crazy partner are back to do the city a world of good. As Martin Riggs or Rogar Murtaugh, you've got a lot to decide - like how you're gonna outwit and outdo the major outlaws of L.A. It doesn't get rougher or tougher than the streets of Los Angeles, where you'll take on drug smugglers, terrorists, The Organization and a hostage situation at a shopping mall. Which of these four mission will you tackle first? One thing's for sure, they'll all be tricky ...and deadly. How much of your life and your future are you willing to risk? As Riggs? As Murtaugh? Choose the best man for each mission. Remember, you'll need muscle and wits, so choose wisely. If you're sharp enough and quick enough, you may have time to catch your breath before you begin your final task for the Internal Affairs Department. This time, you'll be tracking down a corrupt police offier; one who knows how you move! So get moving...and do it carefully!</Description>

		<Description>It couldn't be simpler. You get pieces of different sizes and shapes. One by one you put them down on the playing board - soon you've made your first loop. Yeaaaah! Now it's not so easy. This time you didn't get the pieces you wanted. Never mind - just start another loop. All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life). Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A). Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about LOOPZ. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record. Will LOOPZ drive you crazy? You bet!</Description>

		<Description>Follow us on Twitter: Elite_SystemsLords of Chaos (a game for 8-bit personal / home computers released in 1990) is one of THE defining games of the early 1990s.The Lords of Chaos app will be offered as an in-app purchase from within the Elite Collection app. (The in-app will be priced at £0.69/€0.79/US$0.99 and it may include one or more other 8-bit games).The Lords of Chaos app is also available in this stand-alone form. It does not include any other 8-bit games but it does include an infinite lives version.The Lords of Chaos app is the near-100% original 8-bit game, as programmed by Julian Gollop and published by Blade Software in 1990 and is brought to you - as an officially licenced product - utilizing our Elite Collection technology.Featuring:- portrait and landscape play / display modes- iDaptive (user-definable, game-specific joystick, keypad &amp; canvass) Controls- (Google: "Tiny URL 22qh8hl") for more info- ‘auto save’, on exiting the game- authentic '8-Bit' soundAbout Lords of Chaos (LoC): Lords of Chaos is a turn-based tactics game. It is the sequel to Chaos and an ancestor of the popular X-COM series of games, also written by Julian Gollop. In Lords of Chaos each player controls a wizard who can cast various magic spells. The spells have various effects, for example summoning other creatures (which the player also controls), or damaging opposing creatures and wizards. (In its original form the game could be played against a computer-controlled opponent or by up to four human players). Before embarking on the game's levels, the player is asked to design a wizard. This is done by splitting experience points amongst mana, action points, stamina, constitution, combat, defense and magic resistance. Remaining experience points are spent on spells. Spells may be offensive in nature (magic bolt, curse), potions (speed potion, healing potion), utility (teleport, magic eye) or summoning (goblin, unicorn, etc). These spells continue the theme from Chaos and include some of that game's more unusual elements (gooey blob, for example.) After completing each scenario, the player may spend accumulated experience points to further improve their wizard. The aim of each level of the game is for a player's wizard to reach a portal which appears after a preset number of turns. To do this, the player's wizard and creatures move around a map composed of square tiles, each of which represents one of various terrain types (for example, forest or the wall of a building). During a player's turn, only the parts of the map which that player's wizard or creatures have previously seen are shown, thus leading to other human players having to look away from the screen during each turn to avoid learning information they "shouldn't" know. Points are awarded for a player's wizard reaching the portal, for holding items of treasure (for example, valuable gems) when the wizard reaches the portal, or for enemy creatures killed during the level. Each level ends when all wizards have reached the portal or been killed, or when the portal disappears after a fixed number of turns (in which case all the remaining wizards lose). During each turn, each creature has a fixed number of action points which it can use to accomplish actions, for example moving, fighting hand-to-hand or shooting ranged weapons. When a creature's action points are used up for the turn, it can take no further actions until all the players have had a turn.About Elite®: Elite Systems Ltd was incorporated in England in 1984.</Description>

		<Description>Ever since you arrived at G.U.E. Tech, you've heard stories about the creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some so ancient that they contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable junk. Until now, you've never ventured lower than the ground floors of the monolithic classroom and dorm buildings, avoiding the warren of tunnels that connect them.
But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths of the institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside, making the outdoors as threatening as anything you could imagine within. Perhaps it's the nightmare you had, hinting at horrific mysteries below and leaving you with a strange object that seems to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps it's just another way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper you have due tomorrow.
In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your computer and into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly, you're in a world that rivals your most hideos visions, a realm of horror lurking beneath the calm corridors and study halls.
Shapes emerge from dark corners. Eerie sounds draw closer. Slimy passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will feed your nightmares for weeks.
THE LURKING HORROR recalls the ghastly visions of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world into a frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will challenge both first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's chilling descriptions will leave you with images you'll never forget.</Description>

		<Description>You have the tools to save the planet Harmony. But do you have the guts?
Enter the world of Maelstrom. A world where only the strong survive - and every decision could be your last.

Match wits with the evil Syndicate
As Overlord of Harmony, you must defeat the Syndicate - whose forces will use any means to destroy you first. From sabotage to espionage, kidnapping to murder, even all-out military attack.
You'll direct intergalactic battles. Mount intelligence operations. Manage natural resources, and more. Matching wits with the Syndicate in a battle to the death.

Heart-stopping Action, in Graphic Detail
In a typical Maelstrom moment, you're watching from your Executron 1200 "holo-desk" as your warships wage a desperate battle. Suddenly a messenger appears on your screen with an urgent message: a leading scientist has been kidnapped! You view the videotape in horror as you try to remind yourself: "it's only a game."

Never the Same Game Twice
Maelstrom is non-sequential, so you can't predict the outcome. Hundreds of characters interact in an ever-changing world, all with their own stories and motivations. Every game is a one-of-a-kind experience.</Description>

		<Description>Long ago in a faraway land, there lived the peaceful people of Merlwood. Here, the art of magic had been refined until all aspects of life were in some way related to magic, and powerful wizards and magicians kept order.
Then the inevitable happened: Abadon, one of the most powerful magicians, decided that has was tired of always helping the people. He figured that with a little help, he could easily take over; and so he built a massive castle, and conjured up all sorts of evil beasts to destroy the other wizards.
Now the people of Merlwood are defenseless, and Abadon's followers are running rampant. Their only hope lies in you, Paul, a young apprentice magician. Your mission will be long and difficult, filled with epic battles and magic spells. Along the way, you will meet many friends who can teach you spells and give you scrolls. But to defeat Abadon, you will need the Ultimate Potion.
Legends say that if the four vials of the elements can be brought together, the Ultimate Potion will be formed. You must seek out the vials of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, form them into the Ultimate Potion, and confront Abadon!</Description>

		<Description>In this thrilling driving game, armored cars will try to smash you off the road, spiked cars will attempt to slash your tires, and the enemy assault helicopter will never be far behind with its barrage of bombs. And then there are rumors of even deadlier foes farther ahead... Using the latest hi-tech spy vehicle, complete with machine guns, you can force the marauding vehicles off the road or open fire and watch them burst into flames! And if you survive long enough, you may obtain more state-of-the-art weapons: missiles, oil slicks, smoke screens and others! A variety of road conditions put your driving skills to the test. Race down the highway, but be careful over gravel roads and icy stretches. Swerve around twisting curves, and lookout for branching roads and merging traffic. And when the road ends, the excitement is just beginning! Glide down the treacherous river, dodging islands and deadly rocks in your quest to stop the Draconian terrorists!</Description>

		<Description>It's 1031. The world is on the brink of chaos. In the United States of North America, spiraling crime and unemployment rates, decayed school systems and massive government regulations have led to a lazy, contentious society.
To reverse this critical situation, government and industry leaders have developed a Plan combining the economic freedom and strong moral values of the 1950's with the technological advancements of the 21st century. Will the Plan ensure peace and prosperity? Or will it set the earth on a suicide course to destruction?
As the world's first conscious, intelligent computer, only you can visit places that have never been seen before. Only you can view the future. And only you know what must be done to save humanity. A major departure for Infocom, A Mind Forever Voyaging is reminiscent of such classic works of science fiction as Brave New World and 1984. You'll spend less time solving puzzles, as you explore realistic worlds of the future.</Description>

		<Description>In LeChuck's Revenge Guybrush Threepwood returns in his search for the legendary treasure of Big Whoop. He is now a genuine pirate and has traded in his white shirt and clean shaved face for a dashing blue coat and a beard. This would not be a true sequel if we did not see the return of the villain LeChuck and so, in the true spirit of Monkey Island, Guybrush accidentally helps to bring back LeChuck who, of course, wants revenge. The game itself has evolved much since the original. It feels about four times bigger and includes four different islands. Some of the puzzles are very hard and therefore you can select to play the game on "easy mode" for beginners.</Description>

		<Description>More ghosts haunt the misty seacoast and stone ramparts of Cornwall than anyplace else on earth. One such soul roams Tresyllian Castle: a pale phantom with flaxen hair and a luminous, flowing gown. It seems like a fanciful legend... until the spectral "White Lady" threatens the life of your friend Tamara!
Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of eccentric characters ranging from a blue-blood debutante to an overly helpful butler. Has one of them donned the ghostly guise of the White Lady? Or has the drowned lover of Lord Jack, Tamara's fiancé, returned to haunt her successor? Perhaps the spectre is seeking the valuable treasure hidden somewhere in the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the castle. The solution to the mystery, as well as the location of the treasure, changes in each of the four variations of MOONMIST.</Description>

		<Description>Infiltrate the criminal underworld - your mission is to seek out and destroy the kingpin of the MR. BIG CORPORATION - if you get that far. You'll have to outwit his enormous army of bodyguards, gangs of charisma-bypass patients in trench coats, the bullet brain with the build of a rhinoceros and the breath of a dung beetle, packs of vicious canine yappies, the psychotic clown with an evil sense of humor - you'll die, but not laughing! The there's the gas-guzzling cadillac jock - a cool specimen, elbow hanging on the door rail, a serious looking piece in his hand and ready to blow you away as he rolls down main street leaving you coughing blood. It's not all bad! You've got a chopper to back you up, a mean, shiny street machine, some heavy metal hardware and some pretty neat moves. And what about the kingpin... did I say he was Mr. Big? No, he's MR. BIG!</Description>

NERVE - you're behind the wheel of a supertuned race car with one speed only: fast. SKILL - you're maneuvering a car that can nearly reach a simulated 270 KMH. BRAINS - because you're in control of your car's speed and handling at a dangerous pace, you have to use your head and not just your hands to survive. So get geared for the ride of your life and stay alert. The track may look terrific, but at these speeds anything can turn into a danger zone.</Description>

		<Description>Imagine, if you will, a universe that holds only a small group of planets. Each planet, a barren shell waiting to be given life. Imagine further, that within this universe there exists the forces of good and evil.
Having only a single Starbase to work from, you set out in ships of your own design, and use them to colonize the barren planets. You must also recruit, train, feed and arm a galactic force to protect these colonies from the evil clutches of your unseen foe, who starts at the other end of the universe, but draws closer with each passing heartbeat.
Strategies are needed to meet the many challenges you will face as you strive to become a great leader. Taxes have to be imposed to raise money to build a stunning array of equipment... all the way from a spy satellite to a hydroponic planet. Mining operations have to be set up and maintained to obtain precious minerals. Farms need to be established to feed your growing populous.
Even while you are establishing that delicate balance called life, an evil and scheming dictator is gazing malevolently at the whole universe with greedy eyes. He chemes to conquer and control. Confrontation is unavoidable.</Description>

		<Description>Set in the mythical world of Kerovnia, this amusing and complex tale is subtle enough to appeal to the beginner and hardened adventurer alike. A revolutionary text-handling system allows input of complicated sentences and complete interaction with characters (including some very intelligent animals!). The Pawn represents all its characters and objects as if they existed in a real world, storing complex information about their attributes and properties linked to their particular position or context in the game. Your objectives are manyfold: The simplest is to escape from Kerovnia, but you will find others as you wander about the land and communicate with the characters you meet. The Pawn combines a rich text adventure with stunning color graphics and a language parser that will set the standards for years to come!</Description>

		<Description>A multiple-character role playing game, PHANTASIE transports you to the medieval Isle of Gelnor for the adventure of your dreams. You command a group of one to six characters with such roles as monk, priest, wizard, ranger, thief or fighter. Your companions need not be human: they may be gnomes, elves, orcs or lizard men - just to name a few of the exotic races. With this motley crew, you search the lands for the Nine Rings to help you wipe out the scourge of Gelnor - the Dark Lord and his evil minions. You'll map out new terrain, explore maze-like dungeons, solve puzzles, learn spells, gain experience and battle countless monsters. In every town you visit you can recruit new members to replace lost or unneeded comrades. Beautiful Hi-Res color graphics and a spellbinding storyline suspend reality and launch you into our magical world. No computer-carrying adventurer will want to miss out on the glorious excitement and enchanting experience that is PHANTASIE!</Description>

		<Description>In the 17th century, the seas are as wild as the untamed heart of a young woman. But when you set out on the schooner Lafond Deux, bound for the West Indies, your thoughts are only of your ailing father who awaits your care. Little do you know that you innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous adventure.
You barely survive an encounter with pirates, whose plans for you include a fate worse than death. The explosives, the rocky reefs, the vicious crocodile-all these are obstacles which you must overcome with cunning and agility. True, it's not easy; but at least you can control your fate. What you cannot control is much more dangerous: your passion for Nicholas Jamison, the handsome pirate captain.
Tall and lean, with azure eyes that penetrate deep into your soul, he makes your blood quicken despite his unsavory past. When you're in his arms, swirling around the dance floor or secluded in the flowered depths of the gazebo, you are apt to forget your mission.
But don't dally too long with Nick. For your father is waiting, and on his rescue lies the fate of more than one man. Prepare for adventure on the high seas, lass. You'll need every bit of pluck you can muster.
In PLUNDERED HEARTS, Infocom brings your wildest fantasies to life. You'll thrill to spine-tingling peril, heart-pounding romance, and challenging predicaments. To create this exotic adventure, author Amy Briggs read hundreds of romance novels, researched 17th century costumes and ships, and was wooed by a dashing pirate.</Description>

		<Description>The truly great games are those with simple rules. QUADREL is a perfect example of this, adapting the famous four color theory. It may be played alone against the computer or by two people. The principle of the game is to take turns to paint in a picture frame consisting of different sized boxes. As there are a fixed number of colors, the difficulty lies in the fact that two identical colors must not be placed side by side. The loser is therefore the one who cannot respect this rule with his remaining colors, or exceeds his allotted time.</Description>

HOW TO PLAY

Move QUADS around the board using the free cell. Try to get same color QUADS into winning shapes:

* 4 QUADS forming a square
* 6 QUADS in line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal)
* 4 QUADS on board corners

Try to achieve this quickly! If the time indicator reaches the end, some of your QUADS will get locked (you can't move them anymore). But don't worry! You can always form a winning shape with those QUADS and they will get unlocked.

You are sometimes awarded BONUS QUADS:

* Time Freeze (freeze time for 30 seconds)
* Unlocker (unlocks QUADS colored like the current shape)
* X5 Bonus (the score for the current shape is multiplied by 5)

FEATURES

* Colorful graphics
* Fun sound effects
* Optional voice effects
* Background music
* Saves game state

This game is recommended for fans of puzzle games such as Trism or Bejewled.

Try to build your own strategy! Good luck!</Description>

		<Description>R.B.I. TWO sets a new standard in baseball simulations. Easy to play, you can really feel the crack of ball against bat as you hit a big one and go for a home run. Wind up to pitch a fast ball or play tricky with a slow curve. Put on your glove and dive for catches or try to tag those runners between bases. For afficionados we've included details of all 26 American pro ball teams: the real players with their batting, pitching and fielding stats. All this detail, combined with superb animation, sound and special effects, have made sure this is the only baseball game to get an American Major League Baseball Players Association endorsement. For sheer realism you can't beat R.B.I.'s heart-pounding action - if it gets any more realistic, you'll need a glove to play!</Description>

		<Description>Bursting with high-speed arcade action, Emlyn Hughes International Soccer offers the most realistic gameplay ever seen on a home computer. You can almost sense the thrill of the crowd as the goalkeeper tips a dipping shot over the bar! Stand back, and for a moment you'll believe that you are watching a real match on TV!  Sophisticated artificial intelligence makes the play incredibly realistic, with diving headers and sliding tackles, even barging, side-stepping and backheels, plus free-kicks, throw-ins, goalkicks, corners and penalties! But that's not all - you can enter your own team of star players, set their skill levels individually, and manage them through the season. The fitness of each player is constantly changing, so you may have the difficult selection problems - do you take a risk and put your ace striker in the team if he isn't fully fit?</Description>

		<Description>He's heavily armed, rigorously trained, and highly motivated... He's got a six-shooter, "some dynamite" and a big stick. He's up against Amazon tribesmen, Nazi agents, ruthless assassins and other assorted bad guys. And he has to dodge rampaging boulders, poison blowdarts and deadly pits at every turn. No wonder he can't get decent life insurance. He's a desperate hero for desperate people. He's also the most fun you'll ever have at your computer. His name is Rick Dangerous.

		<Description>The year is 2053, and the Age of Decay has begun in the city of Los Angeles. The air is thick with pollution, the streets are teeming with the sick and starving. Crime is at an all time high, and drug abuse runs rampant. The world is ripe for one who has waited centuries to reclaim Heaven and Earth. He is known by many names, and many have told of his coming. He is the beast, the Dragon, and he has come back to restore chaos to the universe and rule once more. So it is written, and William 'Blade' Hunter, Private Investigator is the only man for the job. His violent techniques and brash disregard for regulations got him an early retirement from the Los Angeles Police Department, but now they'll become the fulfillment of the prophecy - the fall of the Dragon.</Description>

		<Description>A sadistic crime wave is sweeping through Old Detroit. The situation is explosive - in fact, it is so bad a private corporation, O.C.P., has assumed control of the police force. Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named ROBOCOP! As ROBOCOP you are programmed to 1) Serve the public trust, 2) Uphold the law, and 3) Protect the innocent as you blast your way through city streets. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including ROBOCOP's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see ROBOCOP eliminated. Make your way past street thugs, the notorious Clarence Boddiker and the powerful Ed-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play! It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of Old Detroit - it's going to take ROBOCOP!</Description>

		<Description>High in the Andes, a biting wind howls through the Incas ruined strongholds. Half a world away, the Pharaohs tombs lie empty. In Italy, the Roman Colosseum decays. Everywhere you see remnants of societies that they thought would endure forever. All are dust. But yours could be different. You could be the one person in history who builds an empire that never falls. That's the challenge of Civilization, the most enthralling "god game" yet developed. You start at the dawn of recorded history - 4,000 B.C. and the founding of the first cities - then nurture your society towards the space age. In the beginning, you'll labor to simply survive while building your settlements, discovering new technologies and fending off barbarians. As your empire prospers, you'll face competing civilizations guided by history's most legendary figures: Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar and more. Now you'll test your capacity for expansion and domination, your ability to outwit and outmaneuver those cunning and brilliant leaders.</Description>

Just when he thought his life was regaining some semblance of normality, Simon's wonder years are once again turned upside down when the evil wizard Sordid returns from the grave with only one thing on his mind - revenge !

Sordid's Fortress of Doom is reconstructed and Sordid has a new robotic body. He sends a magical wardrobe to fetch Simon but it accidentally ends up on the doorstep of Calypso, the wizard Simon had to save in the last game. Simon then starts to look for a fuel called mucusade which he needs to power the wardrobe in order to get home.
Journey with Simon through this inevitable sequel to the best selling Simon the Sorcerer (also available on the AppStore), as he manages once more to get stuck in a land of twisted fairytales, recycled gags and carbon dated clichés !
With a cast of thousands (mostly woodworm) and enough Swampy Stew to keep an underprivileged country sick for a year, this classic adventure will keep you well entertained until we manage to make another sequel.

A hot-shot pilot is required to manually fly the Simulcra's tangled web of 3D danger, solving puzzles, avoiding the flak and destroying the virus. Armed to the teeth with missiles, solid fuel boosters and electronic counter measures, your quest is for knowledge. Look and learn - or lose. The odds are overwhelming. The answer within reach.</Description>

Fortunately, our sleepwalker has a courageous canine companion who will try his utmost to protect his master from coming to any harm - Lee's faithful mutt, Ralph. Lee's 4-legged friend is zapped, bashed, clobbered, pummeled, singed and squashed, but nothing will stop him from performing his dedicated duty... it's all par for the course of a night errand. These midnight meanderings take him to the most hazardous of places... the creepy graveyard, the gooky zoo, precarious construction sites and the traffic strewn city streets, but Lee's loyal rover steadfastly guards his master from all impending dangers - with painful consequences!</Description>

		<Description>He's back! Slightly returns in an authentic remake of the original classic arcade adventure.

Bigwiz the wizard has left the castle in a hurry, in order to turn the Kings son Newton back into a frog. Indeed, he was in such a hurry that he forgot to pack his spare wand, forgot to lock his laboratory door, and most importantly, forgot to return his utterly stupid, idiotic, incompetent, brain-dead nephew Slightly to his parents mud hut in the hills.

Oh well, it could be worse. A sunburnt dragon could be running off with the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak. The wizards spell cabinet might have been knocked over by a Flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering the spells everywhere. His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind panic, have given Slightly the wizards private spell book to read. It might rain.

You see, it could be worse. But as it is, theres not a cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragons breath to be sniffed. Hang on, wheres that pink fire-breathing creature going with that screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or is it something stronger?

Oh no. Get the washing in mother, and lock all doors. Cancel the papers, and shoot the cow. I think its going to be one of those days</Description>

		<Description>You're the only soul in a twilight zone that's like nowhere you've ever been before. It's a space station in the middle of nowhere... an eerie world full of deadly surprises... a time bomb of explosive vapors. And your mission is to find out what makes it tick and avert impending disaster before it's too late. All you've got to do is drill and release the volatile vapors brewing beneath the surface. Sound easy? Not exactly. Because first, you've got to figure out where to drill... There are 18 different sectors to explore and drill in, each with its own unique geography - and rules. Rove across the lifeless space station in your land vehicle, or soar above it all in a plane - if you can only find it. You'll be uncovering the secrets of a complex world where nothing is quite what it seems. And you'll need all the ingenuity you can muster to triumph!</Description>

Use your skills to jump the obstacles by hitting the logs on the track. This either sends you flying or turns you on two wheels to enable you to steer through narrow gaps. But be careful - time is against you! Each leg must be completed within a given time limit or you will be disqualified. Additional points are scored by collecting flags and driving through the score gates. Collect the flags in the right order and a score bonus is awarded.

		<Description>You're really up against it this time. These revolting robots have finally upped and turned their horribly powerful weapons on their kind human masters. Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand. I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets of Dome City and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out this mess? You guessed it - you get the job! Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment, and time is running out.</Description>

		<Description>Open the throttle fully and 'pull g'. Your turbo-charged V8 engine hugs banked curves before climbing up and away off a ramp hundreds of feet above the ground. Glide past your opponent in mid-air before crashing back onto the track, your chassis shuddering and tires squealing. No time to look back - the next bend looms and you're still not in full control! As a Stunt Car Racer, you're blasting around eight roller-coaster tracks at over 200 miles an hour, pitting your wits and high speed driving skills against computer controlled opponents or a friend via a datalink cable, all in amazingly fast, smooth 3D graphics. If you survive to become Division One champion, you're in the Superleague with a machine twice as powerful. Stop your car breaking up under the strain and then accelerate still further. There are no prizes for second place in this game - It's all or nothing!</Description>

		<Description>After losing a confrontation against Super Commandos Mad Dog and Scorpion, the juices of destruction drip from the spiked tongue of the vile alien warmonger - Red Falcon. Now, he's coming back stronger than ever, with a sinister plan that includes having his intergalactic warriors seep into the brains of the U.S. Army. To support his disguised forces of doom, he's recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He's also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth's only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster. And if your spread guns, lasers, flame throwers and mega shells fail to destroy Red Falcon's eight levels of terror, including radioactive lava fields, it's all over but for the shouting, the screaming and the cries from a disintegrating world!</Description>

		<Description>Discover the mystery of the four squares in TETRIS™. This game of skill was conceived by two Soviet programmers. Time is of the essence as you try to rotate and/or flip moving pieces to fit as they descend from the top of the screen. Make the pieces fit precisely with the others to form a compelte row with no blank spaces. The quicker you position each piece and allow it to drop into place, the better your score.
As complete rows are formed they automatically disappear from the screen. When ten rows have been successfully removed, you advance to a high level and the pieces descend faster. Therefore the further you get, the more challenging TETRIS™ becomes.</Description>

		<Description>Imagine, if you will, a universe that holds only a small group of planets. Each planet, a barren shell waiting to be given life. Imagine further, that within this universe there exists the forces of good and evil.
Having only a single Starbase to work from, you set out in ships of your own design, and use them to colonize the barren planets. You must also recruit, train, feed and arm a galactic force to protect these colonies from the evil clutches of your unseen foe, who starts at the other end of the universe, but draws closer with each passing heartbeat.
Strategies are needed to meet the many challenges you will face as you strive to become a great leader. Taxes have to be imposed to raise money to build a stunning array of equipment... all the way from a spy satellite to a hydroponic planet. Mining operations have to be set up and maintained to obtain precious minerals. Farms need to be established to feed your growing populous.
Even while you are establishing that delicate balance called life, an evil and scheming dictator is gazing malevolently at the whole universe with greedy eyes. He chemes to conquer and control. Confrontation is unavoidable.</Description>

		<Description>First you explored the city. Then the cellars and sewers below. Now you're trapped in Harkyn's Castle. Seven levels conquered and still 9 to go. Command 4 different classes of Magic User: Conjurer, Magician, Sorcerer and Wizard, each with unique spells. And the Bard who makes magic with music. 85 spells in all. But choose well - the wrong spell and you're history! Pushes the power of your computer to its limits. So it's fast. It's big. And there's plenty of power for 3D scrolling, full color mazes, amazing sound effects and animated color monsters. Each level is demanding and different. There are more monsters, mazes, "specials", logic puzzles and magic items than you've ever seen in a game like this before!</Description>

		<Description>The Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles are out to rescue lovely April O'Neil, who's been captured by Shredder - a maniac more menacing than an army of mind-altered Bruce Lees. But if they're to succeed, you must command the role of each turtle, rumbling through 6 New York territories patrolled by Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly Foot Clan. Along the way you'll encounter Mouser infested sewers, criminally polluted rivers, and villainous streets run by the terrorist team of Rocksteady and Bebop. So grab your nunchukus and prepare to put yourself in someone else's shell. Because in this to-the-death adventure, you'll control every leap, chop, slice and dice, until you knock heads with Shredder and either splatter him senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup.</Description>

		<Description>It comes from the future. It can take any shape and survive almost any injury (even when a 10-gauge shotgun blast opens it up like a tin can). Its mission: eliminate John Connor. Its name: the T-1000. Against it stands one hope: you, a terminator model T-800... equipped with on-screen target search displays, a lever-action Winchester, and 10 barrels of high explosives... one mean machine. Protect John Connor (before a 23,000 lb. tow-rig plows your Harley into tomorrow). Save humanity (while Uzi-armed SWAT teams try to blow you away). Terminate the T-1000 (steel mill metldown!)... or mankind is history.</Description>

		<Description>Danger in the first degree. Open on a sultry, rather unremarkable big-city afternoon. Focus on a sweaty, sort of sloppy small-time PI's office. The drowsy detective is rudely jerked back to consciousness by his telephone's nasty jangle: "Sam, you're a dead man." Seems things have suddenly gotten very personal. A definitely unsettling how-do-you-do. But who in the world could be the perpetrator? And why? "Sam, you're a dead man." There are 20 serious suspects. And, unfortunately for Sam, it seems each one wants to throw the first clump of dirt on his coffin. "Sam, you're a dead man." A smart gumshoe will turn his old casefiles - and the city - upside down to find the fiend. A smarter gumshoe will also turn and constantly check his flanks. Seems Sam's been put in the rather precarious position of trying to skin a cat without getting skinned alive. "Sam, you're a dead man." And the one man who can help with a few precious clues and tidbits of info just happens to be blind. "Sam, you're a dead man." "Sam, you're a dead man." Guess who's Sam. Have a nice day.</Description>

		<Description>A brand new version of the world's favorite board game created for your computer. The game is based on answering delightfully trivial questions, but the rest is completely new. It's 2045 AD and the earth is a dying planet. Centuries of pollution have left their legacy, and the world has become victim of the 'greenhouse' effect. The object of the game is to reach the faraway, but habitable, planet Genus 2. You do this by blasting off from earth in your spacecraft, traveling through 6 different galaxies, picking up objects on mysterious planets on the way, successfully landing on Genus 2 and satisfying the elders that you are worthy enough to stay. Answer questions at each stage of the journey.</Description>

If you've played the others, you know that some have a little of this and some of that - but never everything a real baseball fanatic needs in one cool Game Pak... until now. Because Bo knows exactly what you're looking for in a baseball game. One or two players - head-to-head in exhibition or in a championship league pennant chase. You're on the mound - 15 pitches, pick-offs and bean-balls. You're behind the plate - call for the pitch and gun down base runners. You're in the batter's box - bunt, choke up for contact or just swing for the fences. You're in the field directing all 9 players - run, jump, dive and throw. You're on the basepaths - with complete control of each individual runner to steal at will. Bo Jackson Baseball has the largest players ever seen in a game and the best digitized sounds you'll ever hear!</Description>

		<Description>Upon escaping the crumbling ruins of Shadowguard, the black fortress of Minax, you lay your weary body on the now-sacred ground. As you rest, you remember your first encounter with the evil wizard of Mondain, whom you later tracked down and destroyed. The existence of his apprentice, Minax, was soon revealed and the crusade was begun again. Younger and more cunning than her mentor, she has been much more difficult to vanquish. But now your sense of accomplishment is touched by a chilling fear. Have all vestiges of evil been removed? Somehow, you sense that your treacherous foes have not been eliminated. Without further feats of skill, daring and perseverance, all of your past accomplishments may be lost. You stand up, prepare your armor, and walk to the dimension door. Stepping in, the hunt resumes.</Description>

Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>

		<Description>The Universal Military Simulator is the most sophisticated Battle Strategy software you'll ever have used. From ancient battles of Classic History to the bloodiest Science Fiction fantasies, UMS lets you recreate them all with its unique 3D graphics system. The program comes complete with 5 pre-programmed historical battles: Gettysburg, Arbella, Hastings, Marston Moor and Waterloo, each with the high standard of accuracy and attention to detail which you demand from State-of-the-Art Strategy software. You no longer have to settle for inferior graphics, or worse, no graphics at all. UMS depicts each battle on a unique 3D grid system, allowing you to view the battles from almost any angle you desire, from an overview of the whole battle, right in to examine an individual unit in its immediate environment.</Description>

		<Description>The original UMS has been extensively developed to allow you full control over entire Nations At War. Across land, sea, and by air, relive the battles of Alexander the Great, the Napoleonic Wars, and the D-Day landings of 1945. Up to 50 players can wage war simultaneously. Your sphere of control encompasses all aspects of military command, from the strategic planning of campaigns across continents to issuing battle orders to small units of field troops. Utilization of accurately simulated military hardware, enduring the rigors of battle through extremes of climate, and a total awareness of the politics of warfare must be learnt for success. The chance to re-write history is in your hands.</Description>

		<Description>On the baddest streets of the city they know your name. You are lean and mean... the karate master they call the Vigilante! Your turf was left alone. Your friends and neighbors lived in peace. Until the Rogue gang got too big for their britches. You chilled, hoping things wouldn't get too rough. No such luck. They've taken your girlfriend Maria, and there's only one thing you can do... get her back... anyway you can! You have fists of steel! Legs like pistons! And courage that just won't quit! You will need all three because the Rogues are waiting with knives, guns and a whole bunch of nasty punks. And you'll have to fight fast. If the Rogues make it back to their headquarters before you rescue Maria, all hope will be lost. But catch them first and you'll fight the leader of the Rogues. Win Maria... and your turf... will remain safe. Feel any pressure? No way. You're the Vigilante!</Description>

		<Description>The year is 2525. An attacking force of alien space stations approach Earth. Scanners indicate that a direct assault would be useless. You must infiltrate and destroy the invaders with the most powerful battle tanks ever created: Vindicators. For one or two gamers, Vindicators blows you away with incredible action and graphics as you blast your way through each station. Your mission: locate and destroy its control room.

		<Description>You can design a car, house, aeroplane (or whatever you want!) and then walk around it. See what it looks like from any angle. Change it. Add color, detail, animation. The possibilities are endless. And it's ideal for creating games. If you're not artistic, don't worry - there are lots of objects already included in the kit for you to use in your plans, but it's simple to create your own if you want. So, if you enjoy playing games, but want to use your computer's real capabilities for a change, this is a perfect opportunity.</Description>

		<Description>The whole of J.R.R. Tolkien's panoramic vision has been included in this epic game. Follow in the footsteps of Frodo, Aaragorn and Gandalf as they battle to get the ring to the Cracks of Doom. Ranged against you are all the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron and the corrupt wizard Saruman. The odds are overwhelming, but you cannot aford to fail. The destiny of Middle Earth lies in the balance. Multiple playing levels let you control all the characters and armies that appear in "The Lord of the Rings" from the broad sweep of strategy, right down to individual characters' actions on the battlefield. There are infinite possibilities so no two games will ever be the same. Gripping action means you will always want another game. Guard carefully and travel well, my friend. May the fellowship of the ring be successful, and peace return to all Middle Earth.</Description>

		<Description>This is the computer game that everyone is talking about - or soon will be - in excited whispers and bewildered exclamations. It's the game with the soccer ball that devours knife-wielding little girls... then burps. The one with totem pole heads hopping on kangaroo bodies under skies full of fish. The one with a giant killer bee that wants your cotton candy, the grandfather clock that paints the way, and the lawn mower that grinds you to a bloody pulp. Like the famous ink blot test, the bizarre scenes, puzzles and arcade-style challenges in Weird Dreams will mean different things to different people. Some will think them uproariously funny. Others will find them strange and unsettling. Still others will be outright offended. Decide for yourself. One thing is certain: there has never been a computer game like Weird Dreams. You have to play it to believe it.</Description>

		<Description>Just when you thought you had mastered TETRIS! Now we bring you yet another mind teaser from the famed Soviet author of TETRIS, Alexey Pajitnov.  WELLTRIS takes you into another dimension as you attempt to position shapes in a three-dimensional perspective.  Imagine looking down into a four-sided well with grid-like walls and bottom.  Rotate the falling pieces within each wall.  But that's just the beginning; you also move the pieces around the side walls in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Your best score comes from quick, accurate placement of pieces on the bottom grid.  Unlike TETRIS you will be removing columns as well as rows in this dimensional puzzler.  There are other surprises in store in WELLTRIS, but you just have to see it for yourself.  WELLTRIS - another name for "addictive"!</Description>

		<Description>A “Word” is a unit of language, consisting of one or more spoken sounds or their written representation, that functions as a principal carrier of meaning.  A “Master” is a person eminently skilled in something, as an occupation, art, or science.  So the question is, are you a Word Master?  

Yes, word searches are fun, you look at a jumble of letters and the words are there, already spelled out waiting to be discovered.  But with “Word Master” your mind has to do the work.  “Word Master” provides you letters, but you need to come up with the words.  You'll earn points for each word that you can compose from the provided letters.  Use only the letters provided and see how many of the possible words you can create.  

This program uses a word list that is similar to the official Scrabble players word list so the possibilities are virtually endless.  Select how many letters (between 5 and 15) you want in each game.  Earn more points for longer words.  Keep track of how well you and your family are doing with the game history view.

Easy, fun and addictive, Word Master will turn you into, well, a WORD MASTER!</Description>

		<Description>World Championship Soccer kicks-off against an international set of stars for the prized World Championship. To win, you'll move swiftly through qualifying rounds onto the Final Tournament where only the best are lined up for intense competition.

Maybe you'll meet the teams of France, Italy or England who play with the unusual bravado. Long on strategy, they prove worthy contenders against the fiery speed of their Latin counterparts from Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. But nothing beats the determination of China and Japan whose team credo remains, "Never say die!". And these are just some of the twenty-four teams, our ol' red, white and blue included, who are ready to kick, dribble and shoot their way to victory.

So how will you play? Tough offense, strong defense? Only one can win. So lace up your cleats and let's see some smoke on that field.</Description>

It took 3 days to arrive at the ESSEN mining station. On the landing pad, the situation looks sinister. There is no sign of life! The facts are, you must repair the ship, obtain fuel and provisions and reprogram the ship's computer. With a bit of luck, the mining colony should have all the necessary spares. But what fate befell the 200 workers stationed here? What stalks the metal labyrinths below the surface? What mystery links the horror within - to the dawn of human civilization?
