You start off with $100,000 and a Dakota (DC3) plane - in 1946, at the start of the air travel boom. You must decide which places to fly to, where to use as a hub, when to buy new planes - and which ones to buy, with what quantity of first class, economy or cargo. New planes become available over time, from a DC9 to the Jumbo - and even the Concorde! But beware - just because a plane is new does not mean it is the best for you - you must decide. You must also find the cash to pay for it; and planes don't come cheap! You are sure to need the help of your friendly bank sooner or later, or even to sell shares!</Description>

		<Description>Armageddon Man casts you as the Supreme Commander of a future barely balanced Earth. The Earth has been split into 16 separate nuclear capable countries, such as the Black African Republic, Japan and European Unite, and it's your job to make sure it doesn't become lifeless.

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</Description>

Throughout the game you have to try all the different possible combinations of ingredients until you find the magic potion. The results are often quite unexpected. Action and strategy combine to form an explosive cocktail in this great game, which is inspired by the film "The Enchanted Stone".</Description>

		<Description>It has been more than 40 years since the first nuclear bomb exploded. In that time, the shape of the world has changed dramatically. The power to destroy civilization rests in the hands of the superpowers and now, as either the President of the U.S. or as the General Secretary of the U.S.S.R., you have total responsibility for your nation's course. To succeed, you must enhance your country's prestige without infringing too much on your adversary's interests. If you play the isolationist, you will find yourself alone in a world dominated by your opponent. If you are too aggressive, you could unleash the war that annihilates humankind - and both sides lose. Balance of Power uses a huge statistical database, a meticulously detailed display of the world, and advanced artificial intelligence techniques to put you in command of one of the world's superpowers. You have vast amounts of information available as you press your country's interest and resist the pressure of the other side. Noted game designer Chris Crawford has created a model of the world which will entertain, educate, challenge and perhaps frighten you in ways no computer game has done before.</Description>

		<Description>Sick of silly old soccer? Tired of pathetic pinball? Then you need a dose of Ballistix - the fastest, wackiest, toughest ball game yet to appear on a computer. Ballistix just explodes with excitement, puzzles and an amazing 130 different screens of frenetic action! The aim of the game is simple: score more goals than your opponent to win the match. Doing it is a different matter as splitters fill the screen with dozens of balls, tunnels hide them from view, bumpers bounce balls all over the show, fiendish red arrows speed them up to almost impossible velocity, magnets pull them away from your control, and much, much more. You can play against the computer or another player, set the speed if you can't stand the pace, define where the balls are fired and their velocity, rack up bonuses that will get you extra goals and then, at the end of an exhausting game, set your name in pride of place on the high-score table.</Description>

		<Description>Your favorite strategic adventure game reaches the computer age! You're the commander of a powerful naval fleet and you face an enemy who plans to make you fish bait. Man your battleships! This is combat that's fast, furious and lots of fun! It's so real, you'll taste the saltwater. Start by strategically positioning your ships against the enemy (a former friend's fleet or the computer). Plan your hits, aim your guns and the action begins. You'll watch planes strafing by, hear shrapnel exploding, see subs and cruisers sinking. When the smoke clears, you're on the defensive, while your opponent plays hunt and seek. Good luck, sailor! If you're still afloat when it's over, you'll be honored in a glorious victory "sail past".</Description>

		<Description>Danger in the first degree. Open on a sultry, rather unremarkable big-city afternoon. Focus on a sweaty, sort of sloppy small-time PI's office. The drowsy detective is rudely jerked back to consciousness by his telephone's nasty jangle: "Sam, you're a dead man." Seems things have suddenly gotten very personal. A definitely unsettling how-do-you-do. But who in the world could be the perpetrator? And why? "Sam, you're a dead man." There are 20 serious suspects. And, unfortunately for Sam, it seems each one wants to throw the first clump of dirt on his coffin. "Sam, you're a dead man." A smart gumshoe will turn his old casefiles - and the city - upside down to find the fiend. A smarter gumshoe will also turn and constantly check his flanks. Seems Sam's been put in the rather precarious position of trying to skin a cat without getting skinned alive. "Sam, you're a dead man." And the one man who can help with a few precious clues and tidbits of info just happens to be blind. "Sam, you're a dead man." "Sam, you're a dead man." Guess who's Sam. Have a nice day.</Description>

Time gates give you an additional two seconds on the next leg so drive through them if you can. Collecting the flags in the specified order gives you extra points. Avoid hitting the fences, walls, trees and other obstacles as they'll flip your buggy over and slow you down. You are competing against the clock so don't waste time, push the pedal flat to the floor. Try jumping obstacles by hitting the logs that lie across the track. Show off your driving skills by running over molehills and tree stumps, tipping your car onto two wheels - see how long you can keep your buggy in this trick position. Now fasten your seatbelt for the ride of your life!</Description>

		<Description>The CK23 test development site is the most secret military complex on earth. Hidden somewhere on a mountainous and now deserted island, it is surrounded by deadly minefields, high voltage electric fences and surveillance cameras. The island itself is bristling with military activity, from armed foot patrols to roaming lethal tanks. It is your mission to explore the island and find the heart of the development complex. Once there you must steal the design of the CK23 and then set a time delay bomb in the nuclear reactor. The explosion which follows will devastate the entire island. The action takes place on a moonless night, hence you have been provided with a Sightless Image Enhancer (SIE) with head-up display. Using advanced 3D-vector graphics with full collision detection, you will see an accurate picture of your 'world' as you move within it. You will be able to see and explore entire villages. Around any corner could lurk an armed guard or tank ready to dispatch instant death. Being quick on the trigger is essential for survival. It is also possible to enter and explore buildings - which may contain vital information or boobytraps. The civilian workforce hid a network of 'spies'. Unfortunately they have all been evacuated but you must understand their incredible mission if you are to succeed. This alone will test your powers of reasoning and deduction to the full. Catch 23 is a vast game with one of the biggest challenges ever designed on a home microcomputer. It is the closest thing yet to actually being there.</Description>

		<Description>Championship Baseball has it all. You begin by drafting a team. Look over the talent pool. You'll need starting pitchers, relievers, infielders, outfielders, even utility players for bench strength. Consider each player's talents carefully before putting them on your team. Once you've selected your team, set your batting order. Then choose which of the four divisions suits you, and play ball! Championship Baseball gives you more options. You may want to start with some batting practice to master the fine art of hitting a screwball. Then, challenge a friend or the computer to 9 innings of intense action. When you're ready, pick your team and enter the 4-division, 24-team race for the pennant! You control all the action - pitching, hitting, catching, outfield relays, base running, even sliding under tags. All in the most realistic baseball simulation you can find!</Description>

		<Description>And now we proudly present the Sultans of Slam. The Champs of Chokes. The meanest, nastiest, foulest fighters the canvas has ever seen. We bring you the guys who use every dirty trick known to man, and a few that aren't! Take on any 8 rowdy wrestlers, each with his own individual style when it comes to busting heads. Use leg drops, spin kicks, body slams, rope bouncing, a flying drop kick, a suplex, an airspin, even the famous atomic drop to mangle those dudes. You'll need over 200 stitches if you don't. The crowd will cheer. They'll boo. They'll egg you on, or simply throw eggs instead. The scoring is based on the complexity of your moves and, of course, your strength. And one day, probably long after your poor battered head resembles an over-cooked cabbage, you'll be good enough to win the title. And the coveted "Championship Wrestling Belt" will be yours!</Description>

Explora is still there, but does this technological wonder invented by an aged scientist at the very beginning of the twentieth century have enough fuel to bring you back to your origins? Unfortunately, the teleportation phase is disturbed by a major incident - a disorder in the temporal turbines has caused the engine to overheat and to use up too much of the metal essential to fuel the supergenerator. Yet again catapulted into the world of the unknown, you are going to have to use every last bit of intelligence to come out on top in these new trials. Your main preoccupation will be to find the metal so necessary to Explora.</Description>

		<Description>You have only a very short time to prove your father innocent of a murder he's been jailed for... or he faces the death sentence! Use his Private Eye's office to run your own investigation. You'll need to hack into his computer files, phone his contacts, talk to some strange people - and do some legwork around town looking for vital clues! All this will take cash - so you'd better strike lucky on the Black Market, or you'll have to borrow from the loanshark. Crime City is a deep game crammed with locations to explore - all beautifully drawn and full of objects to examine and collect and people to speak to (in person and by phone). And beware - the game is also truly interactive: people's attitude towards you depend on your behavior in the game!</Description>

		<Description>After you saved the entire city of Phlan and located the Pool of Radiance, a simple trip to Tilverton should have been as easy as a noon-day stroll. But it wasn't...
Ambushed, captured, and knocked unconscious, you awake with no idea who attacked you or how you arrived in Tilverton. You only know that five azure-blue symbols are imprinted just under the skin of your right arm.
The mystical power of the azure symbols ensnares your will like metal bonds! And when the bonds glow, you must do as they command. No magic dispels the bonds and no cleric's prayers remove them.
Your only hope: search the Forgotten Realms for members of the alliance who created the bonds and regain control of your own destiny. Only then can you be free of the Curse of the Azure Bonds.</Description>

		<Description>First the Black Plague, now this. Drax, the evil sorcerer, is holding Princess Mariana captive in his dark and dismal dungeon. He'll only release her to the warrior who can defeat his barbarian guards in deadly sword combat. While Drax looks on you'll fight one-on-one against a string of his ruthless slaves - clashing swords in the forgotten dungeon, Drax's throne room, the molten lava bed and in the dark, enchanted forest. As Gorth the hero-warrior, you'll need to sharpen your sword skills - using powerful combination moves to cut down your opponents. If you fail, the court gremlin will throw you on the heap with the rest of the warriors. And then what will become of lovely Princess Mariana?</Description>

Your final objective is to destroy the mothership in Level 7 with an accurately placed bomb. Levels 1 through 7 are then repeated, but become more difficult. Various hazards are encountered during the missions. Rockets fire up from the ground, UFOs bounce up and down and meteors shoot across the screen. If you run out of fuel, you perish.

		<Description>Strategy is vital in this chivalrous charade, and smarts will protect your hide better than armor as you command the role of a brave Saxon knight destined to avenge King Richard's murder. To reclaim the crown and conquer the heart of a beautiful maiden, you must outwit and outmaneuver hordes of medieval marauders. Read maps, plan raids, even team with Robin Hood, then plunder enemy strongholds, dueling for gold needed to build an army of mercenary vassals. You'll also need to stash cash for catapults that launch boulders, fire and disease into formidable fortresses. So wise up and rise up to this unique challenge where leadership is as important as swordmanship. For when you've survived this strategic adventure, complete with daring jousts and courageous castle sieges, you won't be sorry - you'll be king!</Description>

And your mission is to find out what makes it tick and avert impending disaster before it's too late. All you've got to do is drill and release the volatile vapors brewing beneath the surface. Sound easy? Not exactly. Because first, you've got to figure out where to drill... There are 18 different sectors to explore and drill in, each with its own unique geography - and rules. Rove across the lifeless space station in your land vehicle, or soar above it all in a plane - if you can only find it. You'll be uncovering the secrets of a complex world where nothing is quite what it seems. And you'll need all the ingenuity you can muster to triumph!</Description>

Should you resist the tempting treasures, defeat the hideous monsters, and escape the devious traps that are hidden throughout the Grey Lord's dreadful dungeon?
Yes? Then perhaps you'll be the one to enter the caves of the sacred mountain and retrieve the Firestaff from the evil Lord Chaos. To succeed, you must assemble a band of four champions and lead them in fierce battles against the terrible Dark Lord who now rules your master's dungeon.
And if you fail? At best, you'll meet your ghastly end in the dungeon's wretched catacombs, like hundreds of brave adventurers who went before you. Far worse, you might become a captive "trophy" of the evil Lord Chaos, suspended forever in the haunting mirrors of the Hall of Champions.</Description>

You can almost sense the thrill of the crowd as the goalkeeper tips a dipping shot over the bar! Stand back, and for a moment you'll believe that you are watching a real match on TV!  Sophisticated artificial intelligence makes the play incredibly realistic, with diving headers and sliding tackles, even barging, side-stepping and backheels, plus free-kicks, throw-ins, goalkicks, corners and penalties! But that's not all - you can enter your own team of star players, set their skill levels individually, and manage them through the season. The fitness of each player is constantly changing, so you may have the difficult selection problems - do you take a risk and put your ace striker in the team if he isn't fully fit?</Description>

Release a deadly grenade to devastate a birth pod and shoot the hordes of aliens that slither and scramble to overwhelm you. Rocket a gun emplacement and pneumatic hammers hurl you end over end back across the screen. And in a new twist, some of the screens can be played as a vulnerable but athletic Vitorc or as Exolon, a lumbering but powerful exoskeleton.</Description>

		<Description>After a great many ups and downs, and a mind-boggling chase in a spatial-temporal universe, you have finally caught up with your father's murderer and you are about to return to the family chateau in 1922. Explora is still there, but does this technological wonder invented by an aged scientist at the very beginning of the twentieth century have enough fuel to bring you back to your origins? Unfortunately, the teleportation phase is disturbed by a major incident - a disorder in the temporal turbines has caused the engine to overheat and to use up too much of the metal essential to fuel the supergenerator. Yet again catapulted into the world of the unknown, you are going to have to use every last bit of intelligence to come out on top in these new trials. Your main preoccupation will be to find the metal so necessary to Explora.</Description>

		<Description>THE FINAL BATTLE              The game is fully translated into several languages:EnglishGermanGreekItalianRussianFrenchSpanishThe Final Battle is the best game we ever made.It is a new, huge and funny adventure game which reminds us the old classic ones. The plot is happening at the age of the knights. Your character is a guy which wakes up in a prison cell with amnesia. He doesn''''''''''''''t even know who he is! Your task is to escape from the prison and find out the entire story behind your capture. And of course try to stay alive...FEATURES:* Huge game (over 50 places!)* QVGA crystal clear cartoon graphics.* Deep story with many turnovers.* Amazing music and sounds.* Funny dialogs that will make you laugh.* Fully translated into several languages.* Pure adventure riddles and puzzles.* Launching new easy point and click game play with subtitles.* QVGA, 240x320 &amp; 320x240 support!* Funny cinematic scenes* Automatic save and continue system which saves up to the last click.* And as always, export your Hi-Score online and compare it with everybody.        The point and click interface is as easy as that. You point         and click somewhere on the game and you have two options:         'Examine' (Click the eye) or 'Operate' (Click the hand).         'Examine' looks at the spot you clicked and 'Operate'         tries to do something with this spot.                        Sometimes there are multiple choices that you can do or say.         E.g.: 'Take the bottle' and 'Leave the bottle there'.         In this case you will see this choice box before the text.         Just click the choice you wish once to select it and once         more         to activate it. Its as simple as that!                        The game is really open. You can go almost wherever you         want. If you want to get out of a place and visit another one       just 'Operate' on this icon. It means that there is an exit.                  This is your characters icon. It shows where you are standing on       the place. You can climb ladders, sit on chairs etc. You can 'Use      Items from the inventory' to that icon as if you want to       'Operate' something on you. E.g.: If you have a trousers in       the inventory and you want to wear it. You must click the       trousers and then this icon.                        This is the main user interface of the game. The 'heart' shows your lives       left. The 'P' shows your current points. 'Menu' goes to the games menus.       'Back arrow' saves and goes to main screen. 'X' button saves and exits       the game. The 'Speaker' button mutes the sound and music.             These eight blank spots are your inventory. (Your pockets). Every       item you take its stored there. It you take more than eight items then the'down and up arrows' are activated and you can scroll to view all your       items. To 'USE' and item just click it once (gets a red border) and then click       the place you want to use it. After you click it once and if you want to cancel       that action, just click the 'Eye and Hand button' and you get the normal       point and click interface again. You can click an item in the inventory and       then click a second item in the inventory if you want to combine two items       together.</Description>

Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand... I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out the mess? You guessed - you get the job. Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment and time is running out.</Description>

		<Description>There's a lot more to football than X's and O's. You haven't really experienced football until you've been down on the field, with an outside linebacker headed straight for you and nobody blocking him. There's a word for that experience - the word is pain. You haven't felt the real excitement of football until you've run the perfect pass pattern, broken free near the end zone, and caught the winning touchdown pass. There's a reward for that kind of performance - the reward is victory! You haven't seen real computer football until you've seen GFL Championship Football. It has what no other computer football program has: in-the-helmet perspective to put you down on the field, where the action is! Which is where you want to be if you're looking for real football. X's and O's were never like this!</Description>

		<Description>My Story..... Fifty years ago, my Grandfather, a brave and bold warrior, defeated a powerful force of space pirates to secure a new world for the human race, who were fleeing from the now dead Earth. The past five decades of life on the Ring-Worlds of Triton have altered the life of the Human Race. Man is no longer a warrior; his technological advancement has bred a new fighter. Robot pilots now defend his new home. With no concept of fear and reactions a little slower than the speed of light, they are the formidable force which has prevented reprisals from the pirates; until now.
In a daring and swift surprise raid, most of these robot pilots were captured by the pirates, and are now being held on the 16 disused space research platforms on which they were forced to take refuge. The pirates are probably planning an attack on the Ring-Worlds which, now undefended, will undoubtedly fall; especially it our own robots are used against us. It is imperative that these robots are returned, or at least destroyed, otherwise the Human race will come to an end.
As the decendent of The Goldrunner; now a legendary hero, I am the only one who can take on the near impossible task of flying a single seater fighter to the platforms, surviving the pirates own substantial cyborg defence system completely unaided, and recovering as many robots as I can. Even with the latest Goldrunner II fighter this will be an extremely difficult mission, and I can only be expected to do my best. However; I must bear in mind that if my best is not good enough, the human race will die.</Description>

		<Description>Why buy this game when you could steal it? Except you can't. Not yet. An amateur like you? Come off it! Now, if you were a fully paid-up member of the notorious Guild of Thieves, things would be different. Mind you, it's not easy. You might find yourself ditched on a remote jetty by the Guildmaster. You might find that the Guild expects you to ransack a well guarded mansion. To go grave robbing. Potholing. Or maybe - if they're really doubtful of your abilities - everything at once! No problem, really, in a country full of helpful natives and friendly wildlife. Trouble is, you're not in a country like that. You're in Kerovnia. If you've played The Pawn, you'll remember Kerovnia. Except that the place seems to have gone downhill since then. But you'll find that out for yourself soon enough. And just one final hint - don't try any funny stuff. The Guildmaster has seen it all before. So has the Gatekeeper. So has the... But why should we give you any hints?</Description>

		<Description>No, you haven't been drafted. It's not that easy. It's nothing that safe. The country needs a big favoure. The CIA is counting on you to preserve Western Civilization. The Russians have in their possession a notebook known only as The Doomsday Papers. With it, they can bring the world to its knees.
Using your special investigative prowess, you must break into a place that is not exactly a tourist attraction. It's a maximum security complex located somewhere in Siberia. The good news is that you won't need a passport. The Bureau is lending you their satellite so you can get into the complex with your computer. They've even managed to infiltrate the building with a few droids called Mobile Remote Units (MRUs)
It seems easy enough, once you penetrate the security. Just move the MRUs from room to room. Locate the combinations to the safe. Find the safe. And remove the documents. But it's not that easy. In face, it's downright dangerous. There are video cameras and monitors to be avoided. Guard patrols. And something called... the annihilator. Plus, the only map is the one you've got to make while not being discovered by all of the above. That's why the government wants you. Your reputation got you into this mess. Your skill will have to get you out. There meter is running.</Description>

On a planet aptly named Hell, because of its searingly hot atmosphere, you discover the secret of the Thraxish treasure houses: Hell's volcanoes periodically spew forth vast quantities of massive gem stones, each bigger than a Zullet's egg. You take your ship in successive collection runs, using your orbital fighters to defend the Raider against furious attacks by the Imperial Fighter Force. As the holds of the Raider are filled, each cargo of riches must be transported off Hell, but beware, this annoys the Thraxons who become increasingly protective of their home-grown treasure.</Description>

		<Description>Hackers beware! You're about to tee off on a course so challenging that it would've had history's greatest golfers trembling in their knickers. Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. And it has more doglegs than a kennel. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play. So get a grip on yourself. Then swing into action on a course as legendary as the man who designed it.</Description>

		<Description>The Dark Lords have held sway over the formerly happy land of Haven for 20 years. Their power over the country is almost complete, but the defeated sorcerer High Vanish hid some powerful magic in the landscape. As Sador, the reptile warrior with the heart of a man, you come to liberate the countryside from the Dark Lords. You have to help using your own powerful body, your intelligence and the secrets High Vanish left behind for you. Explore the desert, the wild wood, the graveyard, the village, the castles, the land of the mystics and other areas hunting for High Vanish's secrets. Printed maps guide you in the early part of the game, but later you'll have to find your own way around. Fight off the beasts, the monsters, the avenging angels and swordsmen who attack and drain away your energy. If you survive, you'll learn how to reach the Dark Lords directly.</Description>

		<Description>The chronicles of Anar have long told the legend of a mystical sword, and its accompanying shield whose magical aura protected the inhabitants of Anar for many centuries. The sword and shield were supposedly guarded by the ancient Corsarians, but their existence, and possible whereabouts are now purely part of folklore. The evil wizard Suzar has assembled a fighting force of mutated humanoids, and plunged the kingdom into a state of fear. An entire army of brave warriors has already perished at the hands of the wicked wizard, and only with the combined powers of the legendary sword and shield is it possible to defeat the dark forces that are suffocating the land. Having been summoned before King Darius and the High Council of Anar, you and five other loyal men volunteer to find the enchanted sword and shield, and destroy Suzar before he is able to amass an army large enough to enslave Anar, and the rest of the world... and so you come to team up with a motley band of hardened adventurers on your quest to seek out the sword and shield, as the chronicles have foretold.</Description>

		<Description>You know what it's all about. That's right. The crazy cop and his almost crazy partner are back to do the city a world of good. As Martin Riggs or Rogar Murtaugh, you've got a lot to decide - like how you're gonna outwit and outdo the major outlaws of L.A. It doesn't get rougher or tougher than the streets of Los Angeles, where you'll take on drug smugglers, terrorists, The Organization and a hostage situation at a shopping mall. Which of these four mission will you tackle first? One thing's for sure, they'll all be tricky ...and deadly. How much of your life and your future are you willing to risk? As Riggs? As Murtaugh? Choose the best man for each mission. Remember, you'll need muscle and wits, so choose wisely. If you're sharp enough and quick enough, you may have time to catch your breath before you begin your final task for the Internal Affairs Department. This time, you'll be tracking down a corrupt police offier; one who knows how you move! So get moving...and do it carefully!</Description>

		<Description>Ever since you arrived at G.U.E. Tech, you've heard stories about the creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some so ancient that they contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable junk. Until now, you've never ventured lower than the ground floors of the monolithic classroom and dorm buildings, avoiding the warren of tunnels that connect them.
But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths of the institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside, making the outdoors as threatening as anything you could imagine within. Perhaps it's the nightmare you had, hinting at horrific mysteries below and leaving you with a strange object that seems to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps it's just another way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper you have due tomorrow.
In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your computer and into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly, you're in a world that rivals your most hideos visions, a realm of horror lurking beneath the calm corridors and study halls.
Shapes emerge from dark corners. Eerie sounds draw closer. Slimy passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will feed your nightmares for weeks.
THE LURKING HORROR recalls the ghastly visions of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world into a frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will challenge both first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's chilling descriptions will leave you with images you'll never forget.</Description>

		<Description>All predictions had been correct. The 20 billion tonne asteroid had plummeted to Earth, smashing through its surface like a bullet through glass.
Thousands of tonnes of molten rock erupted and spluttered over the Earth's oceans, vaporising them instantly. Winds raged all over the globe, ferocious, relentless, carrying great plumes of dust and debris out into space and across the surface. Shock waves ran across the planet, the Earth rang like a bell, as all life form ebbed away.

		<Description>It's 1031. The world is on the brink of chaos. In the United States of North America, spiraling crime and unemployment rates, decayed school systems and massive government regulations have led to a lazy, contentious society.
To reverse this critical situation, government and industry leaders have developed a Plan combining the economic freedom and strong moral values of the 1950's with the technological advancements of the 21st century. Will the Plan ensure peace and prosperity? Or will it set the earth on a suicide course to destruction?
As the world's first conscious, intelligent computer, only you can visit places that have never been seen before. Only you can view the future. And only you know what must be done to save humanity. A major departure for Infocom, A Mind Forever Voyaging is reminiscent of such classic works of science fiction as Brave New World and 1984. You'll spend less time solving puzzles, as you explore realistic worlds of the future.</Description>

One such soul roams Tresyllian Castle: a pale phantom with flaxen hair and a luminous, flowing gown. It seems like a fanciful legend... until the spectral "White Lady" threatens the life of your friend Tamara!
Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of eccentric characters ranging from a blue-blood debutante to an overly helpful butler. Has one of them donned the ghostly guise of the White Lady? Or has the drowned lover of Lord Jack, Tamara's fiancé, returned to haunt her successor? Perhaps the spectre is seeking the valuable treasure hidden somewhere in the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the castle. The solution to the mystery, as well as the location of the treasure, changes in each of the four variations of MOONMIST.</Description>

		<Description>In the 17th century, the seas are as wild as the untamed heart of a young woman. But when you set out on the schooner Lafond Deux, bound for the West Indies, your thoughts are only of your ailing father who awaits your care. Little do you know that you innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous adventure.
You barely survive an encounter with pirates, whose plans for you include a fate worse than death. The explosives, the rocky reefs, the vicious crocodile-all these are obstacles which you must overcome with cunning and agility. True, it's not easy; but at least you can control your fate. What you cannot control is much more dangerous: your passion for Nicholas Jamison, the handsome pirate captain.
Tall and lean, with azure eyes that penetrate deep into your soul, he makes your blood quicken despite his unsavory past. When you're in his arms, swirling around the dance floor or secluded in the flowered depths of the gazebo, you are apt to forget your mission.
But don't dally too long with Nick. For your father is waiting, and on his rescue lies the fate of more than one man. Prepare for adventure on the high seas, lass. You'll need every bit of pluck you can muster.
In PLUNDERED HEARTS, Infocom brings your wildest fantasies to life. You'll thrill to spine-tingling peril, heart-pounding romance, and challenging predicaments. To create this exotic adventure, author Amy Briggs read hundreds of romance novels, researched 17th century costumes and ships, and was wooed by a dashing pirate.</Description>

The mafia's most loyal gang members are guarding the area of downtown Chicago known as the Fortress, an area of apartment blocks, warehouses and garages which form the headquarters for Capone's illegal liqour distribution operation.

		<Description>The truly great games are those with simple rules. QUADREL is a perfect example of this, adapting the famous four color theory. It may be played alone against the computer or by two people. The principle of the game is to take turns to paint in a picture frame consisting of different sized boxes. As there are a fixed number of colors, the difficulty lies in the fact that two identical colors must not be placed side by side. The loser is therefore the one who cannot respect this rule with his remaining colors, or exceeds his allotted time.</Description>

Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named ROBOCOP! As ROBOCOP you are programmed to 1) Serve the public trust, 2) Uphold the law, and 3) Protect the innocent as you blast your way through city streets. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including ROBOCOP's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see ROBOCOP eliminated. Make your way past street thugs, the notorious Clarence Boddiker and the powerful Ed-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play! It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of Old Detroit - it's going to take ROBOCOP!</Description>

		<Description>High in the Andes, a biting wind howls through the Incas ruined strongholds. Half a world away, the Pharaohs tombs lie empty. In Italy, the Roman Colosseum decays. Everywhere you see remnants of societies that they thought would endure forever. All are dust. But yours could be different. You could be the one person in history who builds an empire that never falls. That's the challenge of Civilization, the most enthralling "god game" yet developed. You start at the dawn of recorded history - 4,000 B.C. and the founding of the first cities - then nurture your society towards the space age. In the beginning, you'll labor to simply survive while building your settlements, discovering new technologies and fending off barbarians. As your empire prospers, you'll face competing civilizations guided by history's most legendary figures: Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar and more. Now you'll test your capacity for expansion and domination, your ability to outwit and outmaneuver those cunning and brilliant leaders.</Description>

A buncha slimy, horrible, totally gross and putrid monsters are taking over the bodies of the people who live here and they wanna build a weapon that's gonna take over the entire planet!

		<Description>When I heard I'd won the Krusty the Clown art contest, I said, "Forget it, man. This is Bart Simpson you're talking to, and Bart Simpson never won anything in his life." But Krusty said it, so there's no way to deny it. My family and I get to go on this really cool worldwide Treasure Hunt - to China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood. And I need your help if I want to reach my final destination: a guest appearance on the Itchy and Scratchy Show. Here's the deal: I have to collect Krusty faces and Krusty products. The faces are worth bonuses and power-ups, and if I collect all the products I get a special reward. Wish me luck, man. I'm outta here. Your friend, Bart Simpson.</Description>

		<Description>The Tactical Interceptor Wing of the Pacific Alliance train in a flight simulator with an amazing interface. Cortex-Chips, planted into their brains, allow the pilots direct "hands-free" control over their craft as it skims through computer generated 3D mazes. It's fast, frenetic and furious. And now fatally flawed. A deadly virus has corrupted the Simulcra, infecting all pilots and disabling the Alliance's defenses. A hot-shot pilot is required to manually fly the Simulcra's tangled web of 3D danger, solving puzzles, avoiding the flak and destroying the virus. Armed to the teeth with missiles, solid fuel boosters and electronic counter measures, your quest is for knowledge. Look and learn - or lose. The odds are overwhelming.

Bigwiz the wizard has left the castle in a hurry, in order to turn the Kings son Newton back into a frog. Indeed, he was in such a hurry that he forgot to pack his spare wand, forgot to lock his laboratory door, and most importantly, forgot to return his utterly stupid, idiotic, incompetent, brain-dead nephew Slightly to his parents mud hut in the hills.

Oh well, it could be worse. A sunburnt dragon could be running off with the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak. The wizards spell cabinet might have been knocked over by a Flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering the spells everywhere. His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind panic, have given Slightly the wizards private spell book to read. It might rain.

You see, it could be worse. But as it is, theres not a cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragons breath to be sniffed. Hang on, wheres that pink fire-breathing creature going with that screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or is it something stronger?

Oh no. Get the washing in mother, and lock all doors. Cancel the papers, and shoot the cow. I think its going to be one of those days</Description>

It's a space station in the middle of nowhere... an eerie world full of deadly surprises... a time bomb of explosive vapors. And your mission is to find out what makes it tick and avert impending disaster before it's too late. All you've got to do is drill and release the volatile vapors brewing beneath the surface. Sound easy? Not exactly. Because first, you've got to figure out where to drill... There are 18 different sectors to explore and drill in, each with its own unique geography - and rules. Rove across the lifeless space station in your land vehicle, or soar above it all in a plane - if you can only find it. You'll be uncovering the secrets of a complex world where nothing is quite what it seems. And you'll need all the ingenuity you can muster to triumph!</Description>

Update your STOS language disc to version 2.4 using the special accessory, then when you boot STOS, the Compiler is available with two key presses. If you have enough memory you can hold both the original program and the compiled version in ram at the same time and switch between them. In addition there's a brand new single-precision floating point routine which is many times faster than the original routine included with STOS: SIN and COS run 30 times faster!</Description>

Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand. I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets of Dome City and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out this mess? You guessed it - you get the job! Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment, and time is running out.</Description>

Glide past your opponent in mid-air before crashing back onto the track, your chassis shuddering and tires squealing. No time to look back - the next bend looms and you're still not in full control! As a Stunt Car Racer, you're blasting around eight roller-coaster tracks at over 200 miles an hour, pitting your wits and high speed driving skills against computer controlled opponents or a friend via a datalink cable, all in amazingly fast, smooth 3D graphics. If you survive to become Division One champion, you're in the Superleague with a machine twice as powerful. Stop your car breaking up under the strain and then accelerate still further. There are no prizes for second place in this game - It's all or nothing!</Description>

		<Description>Some time into a doubtful future, man has looked far through the depths of space to discover a strange series of constructions linking our space to that of another dimension. These alien artifacts are tunnel-like tubes, through which the hostile forces of another galaxy threaten to pour, destroying all before them. The combined resources of seven planets have built a single craft capable of carrying one man on a desperate mission to stop the building of alien tubes, sealing the aliens in their own universe forever. The mission is to fly the craft round the rim of the tubes, clearing each wave of aggressors until the pilot can blast his ship down the tube to the next section. Only when all the tubes have been cleared and destroyed will the universe be safe!</Description>

		<Description>It comes from the future. It can take any shape and survive almost any injury (even when a 10-gauge shotgun blast opens it up like a tin can). Its mission: eliminate John Connor. Its name: the T-1000. Against it stands one hope: you, a terminator model T-800... equipped with on-screen target search displays, a lever-action Winchester, and 10 barrels of high explosives... one mean machine. Protect John Connor (before a 23,000 lb. tow-rig plows your Harley into tomorrow). Save humanity (while Uzi-armed SWAT teams try to blow you away). Terminate the T-1000 (steel mill metldown!)... or mankind is history.</Description>

		<Description>A brand new version of the world's favorite board game created for your computer. The game is based on answering delightfully trivial questions, but the rest is completely new. It's 2045 AD and the earth is a dying planet. Centuries of pollution have left their legacy, and the world has become victim of the 'greenhouse' effect. The object of the game is to reach the faraway, but habitable, planet Genus 2. You do this by blasting off from earth in your spacecraft, traveling through 6 different galaxies, picking up objects on mysterious planets on the way, successfully landing on Genus 2 and satisfying the elders that you are worthy enough to stay. Answer questions at each stage of the journey.</Description>

		<Description>Upon escaping the crumbling ruins of Shadowguard, the black fortress of Minax, you lay your weary body on the now-sacred ground. As you rest, you remember your first encounter with the evil wizard of Mondain, whom you later tracked down and destroyed. The existence of his apprentice, Minax, was soon revealed and the crusade was begun again. Younger and more cunning than her mentor, she has been much more difficult to vanquish. But now your sense of accomplishment is touched by a chilling fear. Have all vestiges of evil been removed? Somehow, you sense that your treacherous foes have not been eliminated. Without further feats of skill, daring and perseverance, all of your past accomplishments may be lost. You stand up, prepare your armor, and walk to the dimension door. Stepping in, the hunt resumes.</Description>

Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>

		<Description>On the baddest streets of the city they know your name. You are lean and mean... the karate master they call the Vigilante! Your turf was left alone. Your friends and neighbors lived in peace. Until the Rogue gang got too big for their britches. You chilled, hoping things wouldn't get too rough. No such luck. They've taken your girlfriend Maria, and there's only one thing you can do... get her back... anyway you can! You have fists of steel! Legs like pistons! And courage that just won't quit! You will need all three because the Rogues are waiting with knives, guns and a whole bunch of nasty punks. And you'll have to fight fast. If the Rogues make it back to their headquarters before you rescue Maria, all hope will be lost. But catch them first and you'll fight the leader of the Rogues. Win Maria... and your turf... will remain safe. Feel any pressure? No way. You're the Vigilante!</Description>

It's the game with the soccer ball that devours knife-wielding little girls... then burps. The one with totem pole heads hopping on kangaroo bodies under skies full of fish. The one with a giant killer bee that wants your cotton candy, the grandfather clock that paints the way, and the lawn mower that grinds you to a bloody pulp. Like the famous ink blot test, the bizarre scenes, puzzles and arcade-style challenges in Weird Dreams will mean different things to different people. Some will think them uproariously funny. Others will find them strange and unsettling. Still others will be outright offended. Decide for yourself. One thing is certain: there has never been a computer game like Weird Dreams. You have to play it to believe it.</Description>
