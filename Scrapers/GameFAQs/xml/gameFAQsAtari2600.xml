		<Description>This isn't kid stuff! It's the fastest, flyingest, most unforgiving trio of events any biker could ask for. Start with a Half Pipe that takes you so high you won't know whether you're coming or going. Then do a Quarter Pipe that makes doing dozens of tricks easy and crashing even easier. Then try the Ramp Jump. It's the jump that's just a bit wider than the Grand Canyon. If there's a more dangerous challenge open to daredevil BMX bikers, we have yet to test it. So, if you think you're good - really good - put your freewheeling skills on the line with BMX AirMaster!</Description>

		<Description>Whether you're a bridge beginner or an old hat at the game, you can always use more practice. But it's not always possible to line up a game. Bridge by Activision is the perfect solution to that problem. Here are hundreds of millions of different bridge hands (you'll probably never see the same one twice), a computer partner who bids by the rules, and some very sharp computer opponents. You choose the partnership point counts and you control the play, so you can practice bidding and playing the same hand over and over again, if you wish. And you never have to play a rotten hand!</Description>

Suddenly, your long-range scanner shows squadrons of enemy aircraft closing in on your position. You throw the control stick forward and your chopper shoots skyward, barely avoiding a cluster of multi-warhead missiles. Your response is swift, as you pivot your gunship 180 degrees, unleashing a lightning barrage of laser rockets. The action: furious. The concentration: intense. You are engaged in one of the most demanding video battles ever conceived. You must rely on your long-range scanner, your wits, and your reflexes. Because it's your responsibility to see that those supplies get through. So, take charge - you're at the controls, with Chopper Command, by Activision!</Description>

		<Description>The year is 2037. Mankind has finally tired of fighting massive wars with millions senselessly slaughtered. All this has been replaced by a new kind of warfare: the Combat Duels. Any time diplomacy between two nations fails, they resolve the conflict via the Duels, where two individuals battle head-to-head for their country's honor. These individuals are called Combatants, and they've trained hard and fought thousands of test duels to earn the right to be the champions for their nations. Combat Two will put you in the role of such a Combatant, a mighty hero of the virtual battlefield. Prove to your country that you are worthy of fighting in the Combat Duels and lead them to victory!</Description>

But beware -- a dormant colony of giant, alien, mineral-eating termites hidden in ore holding section seven have awakened! The Termites invade the main power-conversion chamber and begin assembling a haphazard nest. Your crew is working feverishly, opening the crates of tiny remote-controlled planetary-probe ships. It's up to you to pilot a fragile probe ship into the power chamber and clear out the invaders before they jam it totally. By docking with your refueling ship when necessary, and by energizing the nest blocks so your probe ship's fire can destroy them, you may be able to prevail against the invaders and save WAYPOINT.</Description>

Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</Description>

		<Description>You control the Interwand Starship in this galactic adventure which takes place in the faraway galaxy of Interwand. Use the ammunition on your Starship to destroy the guard towers that protect the underground enemy settlement on the planet of Antiwand. But don't forget to avoid the deadly enemy missiles that are fired from the towers. And you must keep moving because if you collide with one of the towers, your Starship will disintegrate. Once you have destroyed 10 towers, you will go to Level 2 where you can enter the underground world of the Antiwands. But be very careful! The attack speed of the towers increases as your number of direct hits grows and the tunnel itself narrows making your journey more dangerous than ever!</Description>

I found myself in a time and place unknown to me. The planet is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures. The inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical. A group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive at the expense of others in the society. After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds, these bugs began attacking the good creatures. The good bugs have asked for my help. I have been put in command of the best machine bug on their planet. My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the bad bugs have created creature machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.</Description>

		<Description>This game is not as "simple" as it looks! Select any one of eight traffic patterns inspired by the most treacherous traffic you'll ever encounter on the nation's highways. Traffic flow varies from a few slow-moving autos to frantic rush hour intensity, complete with blaring horns and roaring engines - everything except exhaust! Test your agility, cunning and courage by helping your "daredevil chicken" across the freeway. You get a point for each crossing, but you'll need quick reflexes and great timing to make it across without getting hit. Freeway by Activision is unlike any video game you've ever seen. It's fast, tricky and traffic-jammed with fun!</Description>

		<Description>You are about to embark on one of the most dangerous missions of your career. As a renowned Star Fleet pilot, you have been selected to command an exploration party in a journey across the galaxy to investigate the mysterious planet JINKS. An enigma for centuries, JINKS is a lush, resource-rich world, and could be the key to the desperate need for human expansion in space. It is apparently capable of supporting life, yet it is curiously uninhabited--or is it?

A routine research mission goes haywire when scouting your probe across the planet's surface leads you and your crew into a deadly game of cat and mouse. Can you escape from these fiendishly clever traps before your probe and its occupants are miniaturized or annihilated?</Description>

Nobody but you, that is. Armed with a powerful new atomic gun, you put on a nuke suit and step into the first reactor. Zzzzzzipp! A sparkx misses your head and hits the wall of the reactor. Poing! It bounces off the wall and heads straight for the control rods at the reactor core. You take aim, knowing full well that a bad shot can further damage the reactor. You pull the trigger. Kerpowie! You got it! You see two more sparkx to your right and six to your left. The place is humming with 'em!

		<Description>Something terrible has happened in the maze-like Mines of Minos. The smoothly running robot operation has been interrupted by an invasion of monstrous alien life forms! Aliens stalk the corridors of the mine; only a single robot survives to battle them. Desperately he struggles to find and assemble pieces of his fellow robots scattered around the mine while avoiding the pursuing aliens. If he can assemble a large enough robot army, he can battle the aliens to fight his way down to deeper levels of the mine and even destroy the alien command center at the lowest level. But if the aliens catch him he is doomed and his only weapon against them is his stock of time bombs.</Description>

		<Description>Some say that the legend of grand master Kung Fu Lu is centuries old. It begins soon after the Great Wall of China was erected. Near the new wall stood an old, ugly wall in which spirits lived. The people wanted to tear the evil wall down, but were afraid. Kung Fu Lu was a young lad then who had been granted five lives. One day a mystical dragon appeared on the old wall and threw a ball directly at him. Lu swung his walking stick and smashed the ball back. Bricks shattered and magical objects bearing good fortune and special powers fell from the Wall. Kung Fu Lu tried to catch as many as he could. Lu discovered that the battle for wealth and fortune has a very costly price. If he missed the ball with his stick, he lost one of his lives. And guarding the Wall was a cunning blackbird whose task was to prevent Kung Fu Lu from smashing the bricks. Patient Lu tried again and again to shatter the bricks. Persistence pays and eventually he became skillful in destroying the brick wall. He moved through all four difficult challenges to gain the honorable position of Master. The legend tells us only those who have fortitude and determination can ever match the brilliance of Grand Master Kung Fu Lu.  Are you one of the chosen?</Description>

Well, the biggest hit around was the one about  three little piggies who were into building houses. Unfortunately, an unsavory character named Bigelow B. Wolf was into blowing them down. It was a real drag. Until now. Because, lo and behold, today we've got Oink! A video game that lets you lend those little guys a hand. It's wacky, it's wily. It's one heck of a way to block that bully's every breath. Why, it's so exciting, even if you hate oinkers, you'll still love Oink!

		<Description>Let me introduce myself. I'm Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting's my game, and yours, too, if you're daring enough to take this trip with me. Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</Description>

		<Description>Perhaps it was a form of protest against bottled ketchup, or maybe they were provoked by acid rain. Previously harmless garden tomatoes started turning into cold-blooded killers. Big beefsteak tomatoes started flying about rudely splattering innocent bystanders. No weapon known to man could prevent those vicious veggies from multiplying. Just when all seemed hopeless, someone suggested that since the plants could not be destroyed, they should just be trapped behind brick walls. Now the question is, can enough walls be built in time to stop the tomatoes from taking over the world? Find out before it's too late!</Description>

Coyote is out there somewhere. He is planning to smash you to smithereens! He is also scheming to blast you with his Acme cannon in a very sneaky way. As you run down the highway there are piles of bird seed to peck at. Each pile of seed gives you extra points. But, old Wile E. Coyote is up to his usual tricks... he sets up piles of steel shot. If you eat the steel shot, you will be an easy catch for that nasty coyote and his Acme magnet.</Description>

		<Description>Our nation's defense system has become computer controlled by robotic regulation. Human intervention and interference have been reduced to a scant minimum. It has proven to be a brilliant concept with a fail-safe design. But, suddenly, something has gone haywire. At one of the Western test sites, a division of armed tanks, the ROBOT TANKS, has stopped obeying commands from Computer Central and is now on the rampage. Thundering over western terrain, blistering everything in sight, they are moving closer to downtown Santa Clara. You must command your own sophisticated Robot Tanks from a remote station and STOP this nonsense. It'll require plenty of stamina, razor-sharp wits and strategic flexibility. Your control panel will monitor the damage to your machines, but you'll have to battle alone. Alone, against the robots.</Description>

Man-eating fish and vicious sea monsters infest the waters where you must dive! And you have only 60 seconds worth of oxygen for every dive! You can use your harpoon gun to destroy the man-eating fish so you can enter the sunken ship and recover the 3 treasure chests filled with gold dubloons and pieces of eight. But watch out for the hungry sea monsters that guard the treasure. They are pledged to destroy all strangers who dare to enter their watery domain. And be very, very careful not to get close to the sticky walls of the treasure ship - or you may remain forever a prisoner of that watery hold!</Description>

Sneak 'n Peek is played in and around a spooky old house with a large yard and 3 weird rooms. Each room, including the yard, is a separate scene, and contains up to 5 hiding places. Some of them are in really strange places, and some of the locations can change depending on the game you select. The game always begins in the living room with player 1 standing in the corner and covering his eyes. Player 2 may sneak to any of the 5 hiding places in the living room or exit through the door to another scene. A timer keeps track of how long it takes the player to hide. If a friend isn't available to play, the computer will be happy to hide from you. It knows all of the hiding places and is very sneaky.</Description>

		<Description>You left Planet Earth just moments ago for routine moon-based primary-satellite scout duty. You are commanding a squadron consisting of 3 heavily-armed Mark 16 Starcruisers. Suddenly you are attacked by alien enemy raiders energizing from the ether... obviously molecularly energized from a distant galaxy. They fire neutron missiles which will destroy your Starcruiser upon impact. Your mission is to destroy the alien enemy ships until reinforcements can arrive from Planet Earth. These arrive at the approximate rate of one Starcruiser every 10,000 points. The enemy's arsenal also consists of Lazer-Directed Heat-Seeking Proton Missiles which are fired sparingly.</Description>

		<Description>Future wars are droid wars, and you command the action. You send in your Spiderdroid to take a strategic building by crisscrossing the structure with its unbreakable Droidweb. But watch out! Suddenly there are hungry Birddroids chasing you across the girders. You zig and zag as you weave, saving your secret weapon in case the Birddroids corner you. And if you take the structure, you get only a few seconds to eat the frightened Birddroids before a new droid war demands your attention. Now it's your advanced Mummydroid trying to wrap up another victory. But you face a horrible horde of Skeledroids that are out to corner you and eat your Mummydroid alive!</Description>

Skillfully you must pilot your attack ship through the explosive space-waste; a single scrape will pierce the skin of your fragile ship.

The automatic systems of the seemingly derelict Stronghold are functioning perfectly, heat sensor interceptors launch to track and destroy your spacecraft. Survival depends on blasting through the whirling force shields and devastating the crawling command center as it fires repeatedly trying to eliminate your frail ship.</Description>

		<Description>You're a helicopter gunship pilot on a daring and dangerous mission: air surveillance of enemy territory. Success depends on how far you can penetrate enemy airspace. Can you handle the pressure? Because the further you go, the more difficult the mission becomes. Show that you've got what it takes by maneuvering your chopper around craggy mountain peaks, through deep dark tunnels, and over tall city buildings. All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!</Description>

Score touchdowns, extra points, and field goals. Play against the computer or against another player. It's hot, fast, action against the clock. When you're playing against another person, he can pick his own defensive plays. After four downs, he calls the play and you, "hold that line", or rush the quarterback. With four levels of progressively greater length, selection capability, and difficulty, it's rough and tumble "Super Football," at its best!</Description>

It is armed with vertical and horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability. Opposing you is the Scroll - a diabolic device designed to wear out the wrist and boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters flashed at the bottom of the screen. You must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three words or letter combinations within 99 seconds. Sounds easy?
