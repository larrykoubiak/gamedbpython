		<Description>After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again flourished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet. These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or center, of the eight nuclear explosions  which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again! The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the 8 Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards. Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the eternal gratitude of all mankind!</Description>

		<Description>1999. What appeared to be a harmless meteorite crashing in the Nevada desert has turned out to be Darc Seed, an evil alien creature with horrible powers. By shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work. These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil clutches of Darc Seed.</Description>

		<Description>Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosones. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!</Description>

You're just a basket away from victory. There are only seconds remaining in the game, and you've got the ball. But you're facing a tough zone defense that's bent on keeping you from scoring.
What do you do? Pass the ball? Try to drive for a lay-up and risk a foul? Or just put everything on the line and take a shot from where you stand? Whatever your decision, it'd better be quick. Because the ref has his hand on the whistle, and the clock is running...</Description>

Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</Description>

Neo City is their post, now that a terrorist group known as D.N.M.E. is bombarding its citizens with a typhoon of a crime wave. The C-Force has been asked to stop them, no matter what. Take command solo or team up with a comrade in 2-player mode. Even if you go it alone, you can call on a backup soldier for spot support. Tap into your special forces training to devise unique battle plans and attack patterns, select weapons, and decide which soldier's individual strengths are best suited for the dirty deeds going down. You can switch commandos whenever the situation calls for it. Endure all 5 grueling missions, swarming with traps and terrorists, that take place in a warehouse, on a battleship, at a construction site, aboard a helicopter, and at C-Force headquarters. Encounter secret passageways, hidden rooms, aerial angle views and more. Every man is a walking arsenal with heavy-duty weaponry including rocket launchers, flame throwers, bazookas, rifles, land mines and time bombs. This mission is no cakewalk, but if it was, they wouldn't have given it to you. Hit it with all you've got!</Description>

		<Description>The full-court action between the Arch Rivals is really hot tonight. Here's Mohawk, taking it to the hoop... POW! He just got nailed in the alley with a right cross! FOUL! FOUL! FOUL!
What?! No Foul? That's right. No Fouls. This is basketball where breaking the rules is part of the rules! If you can't block a shot - knock your opponent's block off. If you can't steal the ball - steal his shorts! But don't think these tactics are enough to win. Arch Rivals still requires real B-ball skills like passing, shooting, ball handling, slam dunks, and 3 point shots.
Based on the arcade smash hit, Arch Rivals brings all of its hard-hitting "in your face" action into your home. Whether you're going for a fast break, dodging food on the court, or crashing the boards 'til they shatter, Arch Rivals isn't just basketball... it's a basketbrawl!</Description>

		<Description>A chess board is lined with trolls, wizards, knights and other magical beings. Just another strategy game? Don't count on it. When you challenge a square held by the enemy, the board explodes into a battlefield. Your strategic skills on the game board will determine your fate in battle as you take on your opponent in a heartpounding duel to the death.
With sixteen different characters and an ever-changing board, you'll never play the same game twice.
If the Goblin catches air with his club, the swift sword of the Knight may steal a leg or two.
The Sorceress has no fear of the massive, boulder-heaving Golem. One of her powerful spells could quickly send him into the next time zone.
Explosive battles! Fire an arrow, cast a lightning bolt, or scorch your opponent with a fire ball. Seven magic spells! Imprison the enemy, heal your creature's wounds, reverse the flow of time and more. Summon the Elementals! Air, Water, Fire and Earth are all at your command. One or two-player action!

His game is collecting diamonds scattered in the coldest corners of the globe. Guide Mr. Penguin through each round and help him with his diamond collection.
You must collect all the diamonds and stash them safely in your igloo. Watch out! Those nasty seals have tusks as sharp as blades. If you can't crush them with a block of ice I suggest you dive out of their way.
Hang on! This is only round No. 1. Now let's try getting through to round No. 50. If you manage to get through all of that, how about constructing your own personal custom-tailored round. Good luck!</Description>

		<Description>You are Marty McFly, just a typical senior at Hill Valley High. But after getting behind the wheel of a nuclear-powered sports car turned time machine, you find yourself in the year 1955 where you've accidentally tampered with history. Now it must be corrected. You must somehow make sure that teenagers Lorraine Baines and George McFly (the two kids that will eventually grow up to become your parents) fall in love before the photo of your family fades away and you're left with nothing to come home to. It won't be easy. You'll have to protect George from Biff and his gang of bullies while doing your best to keep them from beating you up instead. To complicate things, Lorraine has a crush on you, so you'll have to dodge her advances while trying to figure out a way to get George and her to kiss at the school dance. Time is wasting and even if you manage to put all of the pieces in place, there is still no guarantee that you'll get back. It will all come down to one brief moment in time when the past, present and future all meet.</Description>

Better load up on pizza and soda as you rocket to the year 2015 in Doc's supercharged time machine. Hang on to your hi-speed hoverboard as you teach Biff Tannen a thing or two about stealing your Sports Almanac, and locate the special objects he's hidden throughout time. Then, if your flux capacitor isn't on the fritz, it's off to the Wild West, where sharp shootin' gunslingers want you out of town by sundown. The fate of the world -- not to mention generations of McFly's -- is in your hands... and you're out of time!</Description>

		<Description>Do you have what it takes to play and manage a World Series team? You've got all the tools. Diving stops and leaping catches. Stolen bases and precision pickoffs. A pitching staff of junkballing lefties, flamethrowing righties, and crafty old relievers. But the key is to know when to use them, on any given day or play. You can tell a lot from your player's state - the most detailed in video baseball history, from streaks and slumps right down to each player's biorhythms - daily mood and physical condition. Beyond that, you have to rely on instinct alone. Because this is the "SECOND SEASON." When baseball becomes a thinking man's game, a war of nail-biting drama, strategy and nerves. When a world championship rides on every pitch, and one wrong move can end your season. From the first costly error to the last clutch hit, this is baseball at its very best. A big step up from the original "BASES LOADED"... and a world away from any other video baseball game.</Description>

		<Description>Thousands of history's famous monsters gather for the meeting of the century. But their volcanic convention center erupts, mysteriously turning them into terrors of pint-size proportions. They escape to the home of Jack, the teenage "Captain of Cool." There begins a battle between the good ghouls and The Warlock's band of evil beasts. You must become The Vampire or The Monster and lead the forces of right through a humongous, human-size world six levels deep, featuring Jack's house, a scummy sewer, a hazardous construction site, and an odd oriental palace. Don't get burned on the kitchen stove or crushed by runaway golf balls. Meanwhile you'll have to punch and zap at all your fiendishly favorite monsters including the head-rolling Skeleton, the rock candy throwing Goblin, the bone-crushing Cyclops, and dozens more! Every monster you mash is worth points. Score enough and you'll get an extra life. Something you'll really need when you finally face the powerful Warlock and his magic lightning jolts. So be a pocket-size peacemaker and conquer the smallest threat to monsterdom the world has ever known!</Description>

Because BATMAN is here - and the action is hotter than ever! Ear-crunching sound effects. Pulse-quickening music. Graphics that are as hot as 16-bit. And this time, BATMAN hits fast and hard. Flying, leaping, and sliding to attack! And striking at the heart of the JOKER. The CAPED CRUSADER has a totally new arsenal at his command: Batarang, Crossbow, Sonic Neutralizer. He's even got a superfueled jetpack. And even more powerful weapons at the touch of a button. BATMAN has got to use all of his power. Because this world is a very dark place, and you never know where the JOKER is hiding!</Description>

You'll be piloting the next generation of pursuit craft, including a super-charged racer, aqua blaster water craft and turbo copter. Assuming you can manuever through twists and turns at maximum turbo force, you'll need to blast a menacing Boss at the end of each stage. To survive you better have reflexes, guts and a sixth sense to avoid disaster. With the speed and G-force-inflicting action of a super chase into worlds you've never imagined, Super Spy Hunter is light years beyond the original. And with multi-dimensional graphics and sound effects that bombard your senses, it'll take everything you've got. Super Spy Hunter. It's a manhunt at the speed of light.</Description>

		<Description>Inspired from the indie game "I Wanna be the Guy" and other classic platformers, the game follows the style dubbed Metroidvania in that you do not have stages, but rather one large area to freely explore. You always die in one hit, but there are unlimited continues in the normal difficulty as well as a password system to resume where you last left off.

In total, there are over 550 rooms, 8 bosses, and over 30 different types of enemies. You will also obtain items along the way that grant you new abilities such as higher jumping or slower falling in order to travel to new areas of the fortress.

Can you survive the perils that lie ahead?</Description>

		<Description>This is an ancient story - a time when men and gods lived together. The peaceful village of Elis was the home of the fairest maiden and a gentle yet brave young man named Orpheus.

Your adventure will take you through ancient Greece on a classic mythological quest. It may be easy to defeat the snakes and centaurs that inhabit most of the cities but how will you defeat Hydra? Or the terrible three-headed dog, Cerberus? You'll need to use all of your adventuring skills to find the magic items that will allow you to rescue your beloved Helene.</Description>

		<Description>Experience life in the fast lane!

Strap yourself into the first stock car race simulation that actually puts you behind the wheel and in complete control. Co-designed by NASCAR star Bill Elliott himself, this test of man and machine duplicates authentic racing from the working instrument gauges to racing strategies like drafting and the sling shot. It's so realistic you'll swear you can smell the infield barbecues!

Slide into the roll cage of one of three ground-pounding 650 horsepower beasts. Then go head-to-head with "Awesome Bill from Dawsonville" and 14 of the nation's most relentless racers in three different skill levels. You'll face them in the Championship Season on the speed scorching banked ovals of Daytona and Talledega and the rubber-ripping corners of Sears Point and Watkins Glen. But test your skill and strategies in practice first. Or else you'll be stripped of your NASCAR license for good (what a disgrace).

But your adversaries are only half the battle. Depending on the type of track, you must decide between manual and automatice transmission, which engine, spoiler angle, gear ratio and tire stagger to use. Choose carefully, or you'll find yourself pacing the pits while your competitors are lapping you up.

You better feel the need for speed to enter the no guts, no glory world of NASCAR racing. Bill Elliott wouldn't steer you wrong, so be careful not to do it yourself!</Description>

With your army reduced to a handful and your artillery depleted, further resistance seems impossible. But in a hidden underground laboratory, a team of scientists has at last perfected a new kind of fighting machinery: a bionic arm that extends and contracts, providing unheard of strength and maneuverability. Combined with an arsenal of rapid-fire, armor-piercing and heat-seeking weaponry, this will put the power of an entire army in the hands of one man... one carefully chosen soldier, who has what it takes to become a new breed of unstoppable commando... a Bionic Commando. And you are that soldier! Your mission will take you through the heavily-patrolled wilderness surrounding the enemy headquarters and into the very heart of the fortress itself. Even to the most courageous soldier, it would seem an impossible challenge. But there has never been a soldier like the Bionic Commando!</Description>

But in a hidden underground laboratory, a team of scientists has at last perfected a new kind of fighting machinery: a bionic arm that extends and contracts, providing unheard of strength and maneuverability. Combined with an arsenal of rapid-fire, armor-piercing and heat-seeking weaponry, this will put the power of an entire army in the hands of one man... one carefully chosen soldier, who has what it takes to become a new breed of unstoppable commando... a Bionic Commando. And you are that soldier! Your mission will take you through the heavily-patrolled wilderness surrounding the enemy headquarters and into the very heart of the fortress itself. Even to the most courageous soldier, it would seem an impossible challenge. But there has never been a soldier like the Bionic Commando!</Description>

		<Description>Fight for victory in the hottest hockey game on ice! With sharpened blades and a lethal stick, you slash into a rink surrounded by thousands of screaming fans. It's time for full-speed, high contact hockey, the kind of bone-jarring action played by the pros. The puck is dropped, you take control, center it and... Whoa! Your opponent viciously checks you from behind, making an incredible steal. You charge after him, crushing him against the boards. Suddenly tempers flare, off come the gloves, and you're swinging fists like a prize fighter. What action! You can even rack up assists like the great you-know-who. Or play goalie in the slap shooting penalty scenes. So strap on Blades of Steel. And imagine those immortal words - "He shoots, he scores!"</Description>

Because Bo knows exactly what you're looking for in a baseball game. One or two players - head-to-head in exhibition or in a championship league pennant chase. You're on the mound - 15 pitches, pick-offs and bean-balls. You're behind the plate - call for the pitch and gun down base runners. You're in the batter's box - bunt, choke up for contact or just swing for the fences. You're in the field directing all 9 players - run, jump, dive and throw. You're on the basepaths - with complete control of each individual runner to steal at will. Bo Jackson Baseball has the largest players ever seen in a game and the best digitized sounds you'll ever hear!</Description>

		<Description>BUCKY'S GONNA NEED A LOT OF LUCK FROM HIS RABBIT'S FOOT!

Today's newest renegade space hero, Captain Bucky O'Hare, faces his greatest challenge. His crew, Dead Eye Duck, Blinky, Jenny the Aldeberan Cat and the genius earth boy Willy DuWitt, have been captured by the Toad Empire. Now you must play the role of Bucky, blasting past the fiercest toads in the Aniverse. It's an intense arcade action battle with eight hare-raising levels. Luckily, when you rescue a crew member you can assume their identity and take advantage of their unique fighting skills, like Jenny's Super Mind Blast and Willy's Laser Cannon... WE INTERUPT THIS PACKAGE FOR A SPECIAL BULLETIN FROM TOAD HEADQUARTERS!

Greetings, warthead. This is the Toad Air Marshall, coming to you live from the Toad Magma Tanker. I'm here to smash an ugly rumor goin' around that says you're thinking about becoming Bucky O'Hare in a futile attempt to rescue the captured crew of the Righteous Ingignation.

Fool! Those lunkhead traitors are guided by the elite Storm Toad Troopers in four toad prisons hidden throughout the planetoid belt, from the Way-Cool Ice Planet to the Burnin' Hunk of Lava Star. So don't even mess with us toads, you wart for brains hare-ball. 'Cause it you do, I'll have to blast ya Toad Battle Cruisers and Double Bubble High Speed Toad Armada Tanks. That ain't the worst of it, pal! Once I've got your pointy ears in my sights, I'll drop the big bomb with Crater Centipedes, Robosnakes and triple threat Triborgs that your laser-guided Wart Remover doesn't have a shot against.
Face it rabbit. Try to croak us toads, and you'll be one unlucky Bucky!</Description>

		<Description>In a remote corner of the galaxy, there lives a race of super-brains known as the Burai. For thousands of years, their vast mental capabilities have been focused upon one goal: the conquest of the universe! To accomplish this, they are creating huge armies of robo-mutants - bizarre creatures, half robot and half living flesh. With their seven manufacturing bases producing thousands of robo-mutants each day, the Burai armies will soon overrun the galaxy - unless you can stop them! Strap on your proton pack, charge up your laser cannon, and prepare to do battle with the deadliest army of mutant rogues in the universe. You must somehow penetrate the seven bases of the Burai, where you will confront a super-mutant guarding each base - monstrous creatures like the Giganticrab, Jawsipede, and Fangskull - until finally, you face the terrifying Slimedragon! But with the awesome arsenal of weapons at your command, victory may still be within your reach. It's up to you to rid the universe of the evil Burai once and for all!</Description>

		<Description>A long time ago in a faraway land, there lived a lovely young princess named Margarita. Her beauty and grace were known throughout the land - especially to Mad Mizer, the Dark Lord of the grim Groken Castle high in the Forbidden Mountains. He had vowed to make the Princess his queen; and so, one terrible day, he sent his ghoulish helpers to capture her, and she was carried off and imprisoned in one of the hundred miserable rooms of Groken Castle. News of the kidnapping spread throughout the kingdom, and many courageous young men braved the perils of Groken Castle in an attempt to rescue the Princess - only to become hopelessly lost in the complicated maze of rooms, ensnared in one of the many treacherous traps, or foiled by Mad Mizer's deadly servants. Finally the news reached the worthy Prince Rafael, who had long loved the Princess from afar. Raising his sword to the heavens, Prince Rafael swore that nothing would keep him from her side, and set out on his Castlequest. The odds against him seemed hopeless... But legend has it that two magical fairies have been held captive in the Castle for centuries. If the Prince can find and release them to gain their help, he may yet succeed in his quest. And to rescue his fair Princess, he is prepared to face the deadly wrath of the Dark Lord himself!</Description>

		<Description>Castlevania was a cakewalk compared to this bloody curse. You thought you had the Prince of Darkness defanged - eh, Simon Belmont? Well think again, 'cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horrifying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts! Talk about your frightening quest, searching a maze of mansions, graveyards and dark, eerie forests - each guarded by man-eating werewolves, fire-throwing zombies and other devilish demons. Your grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains. And where you'll purchase magic weapons, including silver knives and flame whips. But beware the night. For when the sun disappears, Dracula's curse grows deadlier. And your chances grow dimmer and dimmer.</Description>

		<Description>Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosones. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!</Description>

Evil talismans hidden inside a castle have caused the dead to come back to life. If the spirits are not released quickly, they will mass into an army of the Undead and overtake the town! Creeping through the graveyard on your way to the castle, half-chewed arms and skulls with gnashing teeth attempt to stop you. Diabolical scenes greet you.

		<Description>The year is 1999.
Strange phenomena has begun to take place on the surface of the earth.  Destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have scarred the planet.
Moby the top Commander of the Marine Corps has been selected to Wurm, the Vector Zilus Research vehicle deep into the center of the earth.
Ground control has lost all contact with the previous Wurm missions.  Now Moby's is the only one left.
But she's not going in alone. There's an experienced crew you can turn to for advice before you help find her father, who was lost in the last expedition.
When the heat is really on, you can make Wurm change forms from a drill tank, to a hover craft, to a Super Jet Fighter, each specially equipped with the latest Weapons 1999 has to offer.
Wurm is the ultimate game of adventure because it combines the skill of Role-playing with the exciting shoot'em up action of the arcades.
Moby and her crew are a long way from home, but even a longer way from exploring all 20 levels that will give you the clues to successfully complete the mission and rescue the Earth.
It's time to board Wurm.

		<Description>The Red Wolves are on the prowl... Western Europe, 0530 hours, 15 July. A faraway rumble of machinery heralds the approach of what can only be a massive armored force. As you radio headquarters for reinforcements and air support, you lean forward out of the turret hatch of your M-1A1, hoping to catch a glimpse of the enemy in the distant horizon. Are those T-80's you see silhouetted in the first rays of the rising sun? And that roar - high over the clouds! Could that be a squadron of MIG-29's racing to intercept your incoming A-10 Thunderbolts? It doesn't really matter at this point. Your troops are committed. And there can only be one winner in CONFLICT!</Description>

		<Description>Commandos Burn, Smith, Beans and Iron are a special forces team who have seen more than their fair share of action. Neo City is their post, now that a terrorist group known as D.N.M.E. is bombarding its citizens with a typhoon of a crime wave. The C-Force has been asked to stop them, no matter what. Take command solo or team up with a comrade in 2-player mode. Even if you go it alone, you can call on a backup soldier for spot support. Tap into your special forces training to devise unique battle plans and attack patterns, select weapons, and decide which soldier's individual strengths are best suited for the dirty deeds going down. You can switch commandos whenever the situation calls for it. Endure all 5 grueling missions, swarming with traps and terrorists, that take place in a warehouse, on a battleship, at a construction site, aboard a helicopter, and at C-Force headquarters. Encounter secret passageways, hidden rooms, aerial angle views and more. Every man is a walking arsenal with heavy-duty weaponry including rocket launchers, flame throwers, bazookas, rifles, land mines and time bombs. This mission is no cakewalk, but if it was, they wouldn't have given it to you. Hit it with all you've got!</Description>

		<Description>It's an imaginary world that's real. It exists in another dimension, where cartoon characters, called Doodles, are alive. It's Cool World! It was Vegas Vinnie who first discovered the tunnel connecting Cool World with this world. There, he found the Golden Spike of Power - the wedge between the two worlds. For safe keeping, he placed it on top of the Ocean Hotel in Las Vegas. Now, a knockout Doodle called Holli Would wants to take all the power the Golden Spike can give her. She wants to get herself a real body and exist in this world. If she removes it, she may destroy both worlds. She's already stolen the tunnel map and torn it into 5 pieces which she has hidden with members of her gang. As Harris, you go up against Holli and her henchmen to recover all 5 pieces and return to the real world and guard the Spike. Holli and her hoods are out to get you, so you'd better get them first if you want to save this world!</Description>

		<Description>When the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an end, it ushered in a new era of sorcery and magic. The magicians used their magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder. Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank, even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician, making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the world from his scourge of evil!</Description>

		<Description>$23.4 billion a year for a .250 hitter? Baseball salaries in the 24th Century have rocketed through the O-zone! And team owners are rebelling. They've replaced these greedy players with mighty robots programmed for punishment. The result is Base Wars - a bizarre cross between baseball and gladiatorial combat. It's heroes are an awesome array of mutant machines. Metallic monsters resembling man, half-ton tanks and unidentified fielding objects. But forget about good sportsmanship in the Cyber League. Because in Base Wars, winning isn't everything, it's the only thing. And these mega horsepower sultans of swat are armed to the circuits with enough laser swords, guns and ammunition to spark an interplanetary war. All the elements of baseball are here - pitching, hitting, fielding and base running. Plus a brutal bonus: one-on-one battle royales for base possession.</Description>

You'll also need to stash cash for catapults that launch boulders, fire and disease into formidable fortresses. So wise up and rise up to this unique challenge where leadership is as important as swordmanship.

		<Description>Ace detective Dick Tracy pored over the crime files and mug shots that littered the desk in his dimly lit office down at police headquarters. "This crime wave has to be the work of Big Boy Caprice," he thought to himself. "I can smell his greasy handiwork behind each of these cases. But, I need to get some hard evidence on him. If only I can nab some of his hoods - Itchy, Flattop and the rest. I'd rearrange their thinking and have them singing like that nightclub temptress, Breathless Mahoney. Then I could put Caprice behind bars for good." Suddenly, Tracy's two-way wrist radio seized the detective's attention... "Calling Dick Tracy, calling Dick Tracy." He sprang to his feet and burst into the squad room shouting "O.K., boys, let's go. This could be our big break!"</Description>

But Don Karnage and his goofy band of pirates are hot on Baloo's tail wind, trying to swipe the cargo! It's high-flying adventure as Baloo dodges and shoots through the clouds and over skyscrapers. It's low-flying fun as he zips through a haunted house where hats and gloves join the chase. Alligators and natives rumble in the jungle. Cave dogs bash Baloo with bones. Submarines transform into helicopters. Baseballs as big as boulders give Baloo a rocky ride! Baloo's got 8 trips to make so he's got to be a frisky flyer. Grab your goggles, and don't smack into a bubble. It could mean trouble!</Description>

		<Description>Hey kids! Come along with Snoopy, his dusty brother Spike and his good pal Woodstock as they prepare to compete in Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular.

With a friend or by yourself, you can give the world's most famous beagle a big hand as he goes for the gold in six funny games filled with thrills and spills, giggles and wiggles.

The Sack Race is our first kooky contest. Ready, set, go! It's Snoopy and Spike hopping against the clock. Watch out! Those manhole covers could easily trip you up.

Now let's try the River Jump. Just fetch a long stick and vault over to the river's other side. Oops. Splash! Oh well, there's always another day and another event.

In fact, with four more games - Boot Throwing, Pogo Steeplechase, Overboard, and Pile of Pizza Race - and with its superior on-screen graphics and realistically rendered characters, there's serious fun for kids of all ages. (Alternative:... there's more fun here than a month of Sunday comics.)</Description>

A contest with graphics so real, they'll knock your high-tops off. Ready to captain your team to the title, you bolt into the arena with electricity in your fingers and ice in your veins. Intensity builds. The crowd roars. The game is yours to win or lose. But to win you'll need speed in the lane, touch for three-pointers, muscle to power past picks, and the skill to crash the glass. And, if you break free underneath - watch out! Because now you can power home a rim-rockin' slam! So pull up your shorts and take a deep breath. It's crunch time. Time to show your stuff!</Description>

		<Description>Castlevania was a cakewalk compared to this bloody curse. You thought you had the Prince of Darkness defanged - eh, Simon Belmont? Well think again, 'cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horrifying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts! Talk about your frightening quest, searching a maze of mansions, graveyards and dark, eerie forests - each guarded by man-eating werewolves, fire-throwing zombies and other devilish demons. Your grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains. And where you'll purchase magic weapons, including silver knives and flame whips. But beware the night. For when the sun disappears, Dracula's curse grows deadlier. And your chances grow dimmer and dimmer.</Description>

		<Description>The seedy underworld is crawling with criminals. Even worse - the JOKER is back on top of 'em all! Law and order means nothing... until now! Because BATMAN is here - and the action is hotter than ever! Ear-crunching sound effects. Pulse-quickening music. Graphics that are as hot as 16-bit. And this time, BATMAN hits fast and hard. Flying, leaping, and sliding to attack! And striking at the heart of the JOKER. The CAPED CRUSADER has a totally new arsenal at his command: Batarang, Crossbow, Sonic Neutralizer. He's even got a superfueled jetpack. And even more powerful weapons at the touch of a button. BATMAN has got to use all of his power. Because this world is a very dark place, and you never know where the JOKER is hiding!</Description>

		<Description>Something was terribly wrong in the distant man-made Spondylus Solar System. One by one the planets' central life support computers had been infected with a life-threatening virus while the planet surfaces had been overrun with giant computerized dinosaurs known as Robosaurs. Under attack in his laboratory on Alpha Planet, Professor Proteus, the mastermind of the Spondylus System and founder of the Robosaur project suddenly realized that this deadly sabotage could only be the work of his former partner, the deranged Dr. Brainius. Years earlier, the doctor had fled Alpha Planet after Professor Proteus had exposed him for performing forbidden robotic experiments on human subjects. At last, he had returned to seek his revenge using the Professor's own creations! But, little did he realize that Proteus had been hard at work for the past few years perfecting the ultimate robosaur, Cyborasaurus! There was only one hope to save the Spondylus System. Cyborasaurus must be unleashed! The DYNOWARZ must begin!</Description>

It wasn't easy growing up on the crime-ridden streets of this city. In school the local bullies used to steal your lunch money and threaten to beat you up if you made any noise about it. They mockingly called you "Little" Ben then disappeared down some slimy dark alley in search of their next victim. Now you're back on the same streets with a job to do: a rookie cop determined to make the city safe for the decent people in your neighborhood.

ADVISE AND ARREST
Use the Power Pad and the Culprit Indicator to lead "Little" Ben on daring chases through the city streets. Cleverly outsmart and apprehend the local villains and their dangerous cohorts by using the special weapons and power enhancers you find along the way.</Description>

		<Description>You are the elves' last hope. Outside the town walls lurk monsters with the power to destroy anything in their path. Inside the walls, water and time are running out. Soon the ancient elf town of Eolis will vanish into eternity. Only you can save Eolis. No one else dares to venture beyond the walls, onto the World Tree, where towns and fortresses precariously await the whims of fate at the hands of the Evil. You are searching for the water source and for an antidote to the poison that makes the water undrinkable. To find them you'll need gold and food and magic, speed with a sword... and luck. Every town holds a new mystery, every fortress a new danger. Merchants will sell you magic and valuable tools, but it's up to you to figure out what you need. Long, secret mantras help you slip through the mists, but will you survive the next challenge? This is Faxanadu, the legend, the adventure - the incredible journey on the World Tree!</Description>

But first, you've got four major tournaments to play; the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Play singles against a friend, or the computer; double up with Lendl or Evert to beat the computer; or play with a friend against the computer. There's excitement, action and sweat as you play game... set... match - and win!

Top Players' Tennis gives you total command of the ball. Hit a passing shot cross-court or down-the-line; play deep from the baseline; serve and volley or take the game with an overhead smash. You set the speed of the serve and the spin on the ball, giving it a top spin, slice, drop shot or side spin - just like the pros. When you're ready, hit a "Miracle shot," where the ball can zig-zag or soar right up in the air!

While you play, Evert and Lendl are by your side, with adviCe at the touch of a button. So put yourself on the court with a pro. With Top Players' Tennis, the only thing between you and the Grand Slam is...you!</Description>

		<Description>For years the monster lay in the grave, and the villagers went peacefully about their business trying to forget the horrible nightmare days when HE had spread terror throughout the countryside. For years the sun seemed to shine brighter and the crops grew taller than anyone could ever remember. Surely, their troubles were far behind them, and life was one blissful long walk through paradise. But, their wonderful world would be shattered in one mighty flash from the heavens. For lightning had struck the old tombstone that lay battered and overgrown with weeds in a dark corner of the ancient cemetary. And just as fiendish life had once been given to the dead, it would be given again. First a twitch of a finger, a flutter of a heartbeat, then a powerful surge of energy to the twisted criminal brain that so long ago had terrorized the land in the powerful body of the hideous monster. The horror was about to begin again... Frankenstein had risen from the dead!</Description>

		<Description>It all takes place out at Crystal Lake. That pleasant little camp where happy children of all ages go to spend a fun-filled summer... but this summer will be different. The fun will have to wait. Jason has decided to come to camp and terror is the only game they'll be playing. Only you can stop this terror. You and your six camp counselors can prevent Jason from running wild. It's not an easy task. You must first fight your way through forests filled with man-eating wolves, caves covered with blood-sucking bats, and hordes of mindless zombies at every turn. If a friend is in danger it's up to you to help... or else you can just kiss them goodbye. Jason doesn't play favorites. He'll take anyone. Don't think that hiding in a cabin or staying adrift in a canoe will keep you safe. The only way to survive this summer is to challenge Jason, face to face, and destroy him. Don't worry that it hasn't been done before... there is always a first time (well, not always).</Description>

This unpredictable mansion is not a place you'd want to call home. Fun House is a race against the clock where only the skilled can survive. Clock's running low? Find a lightning bolt to gain speed or pick up an alarm clock for some extra time. Better yet, find the hidden warp zones and short cut to the next maze. But watch out for the banana launchers and glob guns which will take away some of your precious time. Can you avoid the obstacles? Can you rollerblade on icy floors or up slime covered ramps? Can you collect enough coins to earn another pair of skates? The mission's yours. Remember... only those who think fast and move quickly will survive this sticky mess. Will you?</Description>

		<Description>Climb in and discover the earthshaking power of BATTLETANK, the only NES tank game that puts you inside the tank! First you'll receive your mission orders; then plan your attack using the Satellite Radar Map. There's no easy route - you'll have to travel through deserts, mountains and snow fields. At every turn, you're challenged by bloodthirsty enemy defenses, including tanks, copters, machine gun fire and mines. Use 150mm shells, 50 caliber machine guns, smoke bombs and wire-guided missiles to defend yourself and complete your orders. Launch full-scale attacks on heavily-defended enemy strongholds that include a train yard, a refinery and a nuclear power plant. But be careful, each mission gets harder and you only have one tank per mission. Six hits and your tank is cooked. So get fired up and ready for non-stop gut-wrenching action with BATTLETANK!</Description>

		<Description>Become Genghis Khan and lead the most fearsome army in the known world. Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</Description>

		<Description>You've gotta have a gimmick!

Prepare to meet your destiny. And put all your game playing skills to the test. Mr. Gimmick is a mystical, exhilarating, and very dangerous adventure that begins where all other games have ended. Violent enemies that suddenly become your ally, if you know the secret. Magical items hidden away in secret places that ensure your survival if you find them and prevent you from even finishing the game if you don't.

Mr. Gimmick's only weapon is a cosmic star with a potent form of energy you must harness. Master it, and the star can cripple your enemies, carry you over dangerous territory, and enable you to reach levels - and hidden places - that are unattainable to anyone but an expert.

Every game you played before has only prepared you for this ultimate challenge. You'll call on many skills, techniques, and tricks you've learned to help Mr. Gimmick survive this evil onslaught. Only the strong will survive. And only the very best will experience the secret ending.</Description>

		<Description>When the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an end, it ushered in a new era of sorcery and magic. The magicians used their magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder. Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank, even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician, making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the world from his scourge of evil!</Description>

		<Description>It's just you now... you're alone... no one to turn to for help. Sure, the odds are against you, but this is when you can really show your stuff. You've got your Nintendo Zapper in your hand and a pretty good supply of paint pellets. Don't waste any, 'cause you'll need them all! Your opponents are all around and they're good shots. Whether you're in the dense green woods, the steamy urban ghetto, or the snow covered winter forest, there's only one thing on your mind... survival. Register a hit on an enemy player and mark him with a paint splot. Watch out though, because in this game they shoot back and the only way to be safe is to shoot first and shoot straight. This is the ultimate challenge... dare to take it... try to survive!</Description>

It's as far from dirty old Earth as can be... But don't sign up to go yet! A strange cosmic energy field with a major attitude has engulfed the system, and the most outrageous things are happening. Ordinary inanimate objects are coming to life - harmless little animals are becoming rabid giants - and the freaked-out residents are under attack! The only Galactic Commander who can handle this ordeal is the eccentric renegade called Gun-Nac. He can oust this aura that's threatening the destruction of comfortable artificial life as we know it. But where in the universe is he? He could be as far away as Earth, searching for a new Game Pak. Commander Gun-Nac, if you read this, call H.Q., A.S.A.P., O.K.? We N.E.E.D. you!</Description>

		<Description>A summer offensive in the year 1999. Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six "G" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights!</Description>

Suddenly, the tranquility of the Milky Way erupts into a frothing fury as armadas of alien deathships swarm into our solar system like killer bees preying on an innocent bystander. No one is spared. Even beloved Mother Earth is stung. These vicious cosmic Visigoths are war starved Gyrusians. And, led by the immortal Genghis Khan (whom they recruited from Mongolia centuries ago), they're out to trash civilization. With our galactic fleet flattened, you're the lone space cowboy who escaped the Gyruss shroud of doom. Now you must scorch through the galaxy, freeing planets by zapping endless enemy attacks with Neo-Bomb-Blastic Cannons and Ultra-Lazonic Phasers. So prepare for the fight of your life.

Derbies, baseball caps, cowboy hats, wizard hats, top hats and crowns? Well, that's the whole idea behind Hatris. The hats keep coming at you two at a time. All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they're history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you'll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head. If you don't, you'll look pretty strange with that pile of hats on it!</Description>

		<Description>The fire burns warmly, but casts little light into Mentors study. The flickering shadows only hint at the vast number of books and scrolls that fill the many shelves. Slowly Mentor walks over to the fire.

Well my friends, your training is complete. You are not yet Heroes, you have yet to prove yourselves. But first, let me tell you of Morcar.....

Many centuries ago, Morcar was my apprentice. He worked hard and learned quickly. But impatience devoured him, and he wanted to learn more powerful magic. I told him of the dangers, and that he should be patient, for in time he would become a great Wizard. But Morcar could not wait, each night he broke into my study and read my spell books. 

The secrets that were held within them were great indeed. Once he had learnt these secrets, Morcar fled. When I caught up with him, I found him greatly changed. He had pledged his allegiance to the Great Powers of Chaos. Fool. He saw magic only as a shortcut to to power and paid no heed to the terrible price he would have to pay.

I tried to reason with him, but to no avail. He laughed in my face and then unleashed a terrible spell that I was hard-pressed to counter. For many days we battled, but Morcar had allies stronger even than I, and I could not defeat him. In the end, as we both weakened, he fled and sought refuge in the Northern Chaos Wastes.

There he honed his skills, conjuring ancient powers with which to overthrow the Empire. But he knows not what he has done. They will serve him while it suits their own dark purposes. But in time they will destroy him. I must watch Morcar and measure the strength of this magic. This I may do with the help of Loretome.

The powers Morcar has called upon will destroy us all if I relax from this vigil. Morcar's legions have threatened us once before. Then it was Rogar who aided me and defeated them. Now they march again, already they have assailed the borderlands. The Empire must again look for heroes and to this end I have trained you.


Each of you must complete three tasks. If you do this, you will be acclaimed as Champions of the Realm and dubbed Imperial Knights. Only then will you be on the road to becoming a Hero. I shall speak with you again on your return. If you return.....

		<Description>For two years, your people have struggled against the relentless onslaught of invading forces. With your army reduced to a handful and your artillery depleted, further resistance seems impossible. But in a hidden underground laboratory, a team of scientists has at last perfected a new kind of fighting machinery: a bionic arm that extends and contracts, providing unheard of strength and maneuverability. Combined with an arsenal of rapid-fire, armor-piercing and heat-seeking weaponry, this will put the power of an entire army in the hands of one man... one carefully chosen soldier, who has what it takes to become a new breed of unstoppable commando... a Bionic Commando. And you are that soldier! Your mission will take you through the heavily-patrolled wilderness surrounding the enemy headquarters and into the very heart of the fortress itself. Even to the most courageous soldier, it would seem an impossible challenge. But there has never been a soldier like the Bionic Commando!</Description>

		<Description>Gym rats, beware! HOOPS takes you out to the asphault, where basketball is a half-court game of fast hands, faster moves and slam-jam-thank-you-Sam dunks! The legends of the Playground are all here: Mr. Doc, Jammer, Legs, Bomber, Wiz, eight players in all. You can pit them one-on-one or two-on-two. You pick the court - Eastern or Western - and you pick the rules, too. You can play against the computer or one other player. Or you can even team up with another player against the computer. You can block shots, make steals, pass off or go strong to the hoop - in fact, you control just about everything in this ultra-realistic rendition of the playground game. Except, of course, the final score. But win or lose, you know you've been in a game after you've played a game of HOOPS!</Description>

		<Description>A diplomatic mission in a foreign city is seized by political fanatics. Innocent lives are in jeopardy. Outrageous demands are being made for their safety. Only you and your elite crisis intervention team can rescue the ambassador and his helpless staff. Position your sharpshooters around the embassy's perimeter. Focus your sights on the curtained windows. Squeeze off rounds of cover fire to protect your assault squad. Once your men are inside, an electronic diagram of the building's floor plan provides your only guide down to the captives - and the awaiting enemy. Look sharp. Stay frosty. Rescue is an interactive action-adventure game that lets you control each member of your strike team through three different game scenarios. Avoid searching spotlights, dodge enemy gunfire, rappel down walls, and smash through windows. Neutralize your adversaries and liberate the embassy personnel!</Description>

The job has Hawk dodging bullets and guard dogs, thwarting sophisticated security systems, dangling from rooftops and crawling through booby-trapped ventilation shafts. And if Hawk makes it out alive? Well maybe he can turn the tables on his blackmailers. Because they aren't just art collectors, they have a plot to rule the world!

		<Description>In 306 B.C. Lou Ban, the most acclaimed artist of the Chin clan, sculpted from the finest ivory, 7 sets of enchanted Tiles. Legends say the original set of Tiles was created by gods and played as a game. Wizards said when played by mortals, it was an art that could be used to predict the future. Priests said it was a dangerous gamble that actually altered the flow of fate. Soon the art of the Tiles had spread across the whole of China, but with it something strange was also spreading. Droughts and then flooding, terrible famines and then gigantic harvests. Everyday something more strange and unlikely would occur, the forces of fate had indeed been blown out of control. The influence of the Tiles on the land of China had to come to an end, but it would not be easy. Like the force of Yin &amp; Yang, each Tile has a match that when united, will allow both Tiles to achieve symmetry, and simply cease to exist. You must conquer 7 castles to defeat 7 sets of Tiles. It will take more than quick reflexes - you must use strategy, skill and luck to defeat the TILES OF FATE!</Description>

		<Description>Hackers beware! You're about to tee off on a course so challenging that it would've had history's greatest golfers trembling in their knickers. Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. And it has more doglegs than a kennel. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play. So get a grip on yourself. Then swing into action on a course as legendary as the man who designed it.</Description>

Cannons, tanks, submarines and snipers will blast you with horrific crossfire, while jet fighters zero in from above. To defend yourself, you control the army's advanced all-terrain attack jeep, with its arsenal of guided missiles and incendiary grenades. Of course these are merely tools, and to save your countrymen you'll need more than a handful of gunpowder. You'll need a pocketful of miracles, and the ferocity of a wild Jackal!</Description>

As China's supreme kung fu champs, they guard their country against the Prince of Sorcerers, who lurks just beyond the Great Wall. It comes as no surprise when this fiend and his ghouls try yet again to seize China for themselves. But this time they're clever, casting a spell over Josephine which causes her to vanish into thin air! Jackie is in shock! How can he save his country without his sister? The two have been an unbeatable team! Meanwhile, a demon horde led by the Sorcerer storms the Great Wall and prepares to establish a fierce empire. At the urging of his revered Master, Jackie must now battle the dreaded Sorcerer and rescue Josephine. Maybe he can learn a little magic on his own, because he's going to need all the help he can get!</Description>

This is more than a coincidence... this shark appears to be possessed... as if it's hunting you down... like it's personal. You'd better prepare yourself and strike back before it's too late. Will you use the mini-sub, sea plane, sailboat or just scuba gear? Perhaps it won't even matter. Remember, this is some kind of unbelievably powerful eating machine you're dealing with. Quick, grab your weapons, pack your explosives and check your maps. It's out there... you know it... and it's coming for you. This is serious!

		<Description>John Elway's QUARTERBACK is the home video game you've been waiting for. So real you can see the game like a quarterback does, from the line of scrimmage. You call the plays, you throw the passes, run the ball, and make the tackles. It's third down and a long four long yards to the first down that will stop the clock. No time-outs left. The weak side linebacker is lined up inside his defensive end. They're coming! You check-off the play at the line of scrimmage and call for a quick pass to the tight end. He breaks it for a T.D.! Named for the quarterback who twice won the AFC Player of the Year Award, this is the game made for every kid who ever wanted to play the game as well as John Elway!</Description>

		<Description>This is the fastest paced video game anywhere. A race against the clock that only lightning-quick reflexes can win.

Three days. That's all that's left to bring back the Seven Wonder Herbs from the evil Empire of Draxor and asve King Voldam. The diabolical Crown Prince of Draxor has sent out a hellish army to guard them. Now he waits at the gates of the kingdom to lay it waste when the quest fails. The only ones with a chance to get through are Kid Kool -- and you.

You and the Kid are up against an assortment of enemies and obstacles that would turn most youngsters green. To get past them, all you have are furry friends called "wickies." And your magic jumping shoes.

Whatever happens, you've got to keep moving. But most of all, you've got to keep cool.</Description>

		<Description>Think you can handle a real Martial Arts challenge? Then how about guiding Daniel-San through the series of hazards, obstacles, and challenges that stand in his path? But don't think that just being able to fight will get you through. This time it's not enough to just punch, kick and jump... this time your total martial arts training will be put to the test. Your discipline and inner control could be what saves your life. You must prove that you are capable of thinking, reasoning, and reacting. Catching a fly with your chopsticks or splitting blocks of ice with your bare hand is just as important as fighting face to face with your enemy. This challenge will take you to the streets of L.A., the back roads of Okinawa and many strange areas beyond. Always keep your mind clear and remember all that you've been taught, and maybe... just maybe... you'll make it!</Description>

		<Description>Sun-bathed beaches from San Diego to Sydney are yours to conquer, as you challenge heavy-hitting volleyball superstars in world championship style competitions. From the opening serve to match point, the sand-blasting never stops. And to survive each grueling round, you must spike, crush, block and make daredevil returns. Timing and positioning are critical in this slam-fest, complete with aces, kills, digs and the dreaded hammer spike. Teamwork is crucial as well, since up to four players can compete at once. So hold nothing back, and bury your opponents in the sand. Because if your tandem wins three matches, you're qualified for the next big tournament, the next enormous challenge. But lose and you'll be just another couple of beach bums, washed-up like a pile of seaweed!</Description>

		<Description>The greatest athletes from around the world have gathered for the grandest sporting spectacle since the golden age of Greece. This pressure-packed competition is as fierce as a starved lion.

Whew! Wears you out just to read them all. The odds in Vegas say you don't have enough strength, stamina or skill, but you know better. And as long as you win, you're the crowd favorite.

When you signed on as an intergalactic immigration officer you figured it was an easy way to make some money. You were wrong. Transporting wave after wave of weird wild life from all over the universe is anything but easy. You gotta line 'em up to move 'em out. Up and down, left and right, or diagonally you gotta make the clumps of critters move out faster than they move in. If the room fills to capacity, that's it, the entire system will be shut down. One of the most exciting games of the year, it's more fun than a barrel full of creatures!</Description>

		<Description>A summer offensive in the year 1999. Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six "G" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights!</Description>

But now the unthinkable has happened: DARK is malfunctioning, and humanity is writhing in the grasp of a ruthless tyrant. DARK has built a fleet of robot warships to patrol the skies, and has created an army of mutant monsters to guard the underground bases from which he now terrorizes mankind. Lulled by hundreds of years of peace, the people of earth are defensless against the minions of DARK. But two brave young men, following an ancient legend of Greek mythology, have devised mechanical wings to bear them aloft in search of DARK's hidden fortress. Armed with the last remaining guns and missiles from a crumbling arsenal, you must fly them across the continents and oceans to seek out and destroy the cruel colossus! If you fail, mankind is lost.

		<Description>You've saved the innocent people of Gradius from the vile Bacterions. But now an even deadlier plague has slimed into the neighborhood. It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you!</Description>

		<Description>Return to the age of myths and magic, demons and dragons! Sure, you've travelled some strange terrain in your video game journeys, but wait till you see where Astyanax takes you!

In your pursuit of the evil wizard Blackhorn and his captive, Princess Rosebud of Remlia, you'll encounter terrors that would frighten the Gods themselves. The dreaded Thorndog, with his heart of stone and face of bone. Monstrous Caeser, of the Gremlin face and chicken feet. The endless Maze of Castle Terenea. Plus, winged dragons and metamorphosing monsters, sorcerers' spells and wicked wizardry, in a land that reaches far into the past and the future.

It's the stuff myths are made of, a fantastic flight stretching eons beyond any game you've ever experienced. If you'd go to the ends of the Earth for the ultimate adventure, Astyanax is your game!</Description>

		<Description>To understand you must go back, to when the world was powered by the black fuel. For reasons long forgotten, two mighty tribes went to war and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all. Without fuel they were nothing. Man began to feed on man. The gangs took over the highways, ready to wage war for a tank a gas. In the maelstrom of decay, ordinary men were smashed...men like Max -- a man who wondered out into the wasteland. And it was there, in that blighted place, that he learned what it takes to survive. 


And now it's your turn. Survive multiple levels of holocaust on the highways, mayhem in the mine-shafts, and anarchy in the arenas. Then face the final challenge -- if you dare.</Description>

Then the inevitable happened: Abadon, one of the most powerful magicians, decided that has was tired of always helping the people. He figured that with a little help, he could easily take over; and so he built a massive castle, and conjured up all sorts of evil beasts to destroy the other wizards.

Now the people of Merlwood are defenseless, and Abadon's followers are running rampant. Their only hope lies in you, Paul, a young apprentice magician. Your mission will be long and difficult, filled with epic battles and magic spells. Along the way, you will meet many friends who can teach you spells and give you scrolls. But to defeat Abadon, you will need the Ultimate Potion.

Legends say that if the four vials of the elements can be brought together, the Ultimate Potion will be formed. You must seek out the vials of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, form them into the Ultimate Potion, and confront Abadon!</Description>

		<Description>Why is there a chainsaw in the kitchen? And a nuclear reactor in the basement? And disembodied tentacles hopping around? And why does that peculiar doctor keep going "Heh, heh, heh... "? Strange things have been going on for years up at Dr. Fred's old mansion, ever since that meteor landed just outside the house. But when a sweet young cheerleader named Sandy disappeared into the basement, boyfriend Dave knew it was time to take a look behind the good doctor's door. Your task is to help Dave choose a rescue team and guide them on the wildest, wierdest mission your NES system has ever seen. The storyline depends on the individual talents and quirks of the team members you select, and no matter how many times you play, the outcome is never quite the same. Sometimes it's puzzling, sometimes scary, sometimes downright funny, but it's always, always a challenge. So if you're looking for a comedy-adventure that makes you think as hard as you laugh, get into Maniac Mansion today. And then try, just try, to get out!</Description>

		<Description>At first, it looked like just another revolution. But reports have come in that the rebel forces are backed by an unusual array of high-tech weaponry - and that the rebel soldiers may actually be a fearsome new breed of fighting robots! If this revolution succeeds, the safety of the entire world may be threatened... And that's where you come in. You must attempt to infiltrate the island base of the rebel forces. But before you even reach the shore, you'll have to contend with enemy gunboats, frogmen, choppers, and destroyers. If you make it to the island, you'll find it patrolled by enemy soldiers armed with machine guns, daggers and grenades; vicious attack dogs; and lethal airborne probes, programmed to destroy intruders on sight. Other unknown dangers lie in wait as well. But if you manage to reach the rebel headquarters, you will face the most terrifying threat of all - only no one has made it back to reveal its nature! You'll be equipped with a complete arsenal - an assault gun, rocket launcher and grenades - to provide you with a fully mechanized system of attack. You haven't got a minute to waste - it's time to launch your MECHANIZED ATTACK!</Description>

		<Description>It's MEGA MAN versus the powerful leaders and fighting forces of Monsteropolis - that strange multi-layered land of robot-like humanoids created by the wrongly-performed experiments with human beings by Dr. Wily. Mega Man - the chosen defender of the human race. For he dares to single-handedly penetrate Monsteropolis' seven separate societies to stop the rapid expansion of strange misrepresentations of humans. Mega Man's goal is monumental. He must infiltrate seven separate heavily-guarded empires. By himself, he must break down and destroy the following empire leaders: Cutman, Gutsman, Iceman, Bombman, Fireman, Elecman, and Dr. Wily. The action involves Mega Man armed only with laser beam weapons, encountering strangely-configured humanoids. They're atop, in and out of fortified prison-like structures strengthened with thick walls. Hidden amid gun turrets embedded in concrete uprights, even in subterranean passages below icefields.

The journey is a difficult one though, because the castle is locked up tight and Milon doesn't have the keys.  You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon's Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle!  Milo can uncover practically anything in the game.  This includes:   items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops!  The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!</Description>

		<Description>Returning from three centuries of intergalactic missions, MCS-920 is surprised by an alien-infested planet.

You must escape the tentacles of these mutants, seek out and destroy alien ships, then overpower grotesque alien guards to steal their fiendish and bizarre weapons. From barren landscapes and colorful coral reefs to abandoned and frozen cities, you will yet come face to face with the alien tyrant in each world!</Description>

Responding to the crisis, covert unit "Fox Hound" is called into action, and that's where you come into play.

Plus you gotta maintain radio contact with Commander South, who'll feed you crucial info on Metal Gear's whereabouts. To survive, capture sub-machine guns, Barettas, grenade launchers, and plastic explosives, until you find and destroy Metal Gear, ending CaTaffy's reign of terror!</Description>

		<Description>It's you against yourself. And the clock. Easy enough. Except for the barrage of barriers that stand between you and the finish line. And, oh yes, little inconveniences such as rats the size of cars eager to leave a sharp impression on you. Don't let that stop you. After all, the measure of true success is the amount of obstacles one must overcome. Like hurdles that bring to mind skyscrapers. And big barrels, as in rolling right at your legs. And potholes. Jump on a skateboard and speed over the green slime tiles. Ever wonder what it would feel like to get shot out of a cannon? There're springboards along the course that'll shoot you through mid-air like a surface-to-air missile. Save your breath. There are 24 levels in all and each gets harder and harder as you go along. Metrocross - the fastest, most challenging, most cockamamie course ever conceived by man or beast.</Description>

		<Description>Guide Milon through the four levels of Garland Castle in his quest to reach the top floor and vanquish the big boss!  The journey is a difficult one though, because the castle is locked up tight and Milon doesn't have the keys.  You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon's Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle!  Milo can uncover practically anything in the game.  This includes:   items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops!  The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!</Description>

		<Description>Save The Earth From An Alien Snack Attack!


Man your battle stations! Dreaded alien bandits from the planet Attackon have kidnapped Professor Einstein J. Cinnamon - Super Genius.


The Attakons are scheming to zap the professor's brain, retrieving his secret bio-nuclear sweetener formula. A formula these evil-doers will use to transform Earth into an inter-galactic ball of cotton candy - a favorite munchie for Attackon sweet tooths. To save the world from this sticky fate, you'll soar into action in your highly advanced Stinger jet fighter, with its awesome array of wacky weapons.


But beware. From the beginning you'll be locked in dog-eat-dog dogfights, battling tooth and nail past Attackon defenses, from the South Seas to the Arctic Circle.


Then prepare for the ultimate challenge - the Attackon Fortress on the edge of space, where the professor is held hostage, and where Earth's survival rests on your shoulders.

The action moves at the same pace as a real game. Sounds real, too! The crack of the bat, the calls of the ump, the roar of the crowd when you score. Play against the computer or a friend. Pick your team from 12 different lineups. It's tough. Each team has 30 players - 12 pitchers and 18 fielders. Each ballplayer has his own style. The trick: learn all 360 players! Control and play any position. Whether pitching or at bat, control every aspect of the game. Throw a fastball, high outside or a slider. Swing for the fences. Hit and run, bunt, steal or call for a pinch hitter. Win the Pennant by storing your wins and losses. Sign autographs later.</Description>

		<Description>Do you have what it takes to play and manage a World Series team? You've got all the tools. Diving stops and leaping catches. Stolen bases and precision pickoffs. A pitching staff of junkballing lefties, flamethrowing righties, and crafty old relievers. But the key is to know when to use them, on any given day or play. You can tell a lot from your player's state - the most detailed in video baseball history, from streaks and slumps right down to each player's biorhythms - daily mood and physical condition. Beyond that, you have to rely on instinct alone. Because this is the "SECOND SEASON." When baseball becomes a thinking man's game, a war of nail-biting drama, strategy and nerves. When a world championship rides on every pitch, and one wrong move can end your season. From the first costly error to the last clutch hit, this is baseball at its very best. A big step up from the original "BASES LOADED"... and a world away from any other video baseball game.</Description>

		<Description>Thrills, action and fantasy! Circuses are always full of dreams and hope. A big circus comes to a city where Tim and his sister Judy live. However, they can afford only one ticket. Tim kindly gives it to the little girl, "Thanks, brother," Judy says. "Be sure to meet me at the exit after the show." But Judy fails to appear after the show. Mr. Magic, boss of the circus, looms in front of Tim who is anxiously waiting. "You'd better give up on your sister," the malicious magician chuckles, as he tells the boy he kidnapped Judy. "Shucks!" Tim shouts. "You can't do that!" Tim rushes in to rescue his sister. Wicked clowns, tightrope artists, and ferocious animals attack Tim, who fights with a yo-yo, a hammer and a soccer ball. Go, Tim! Beat them all and get the key to the tent where Judy is confined. Rescue her as soon as possible!</Description>

		<Description>This special MONOPOLY game brings to life all the wheeling, dealing, money-making fun of the world's most popular board game - and adds the fast action, hands-on excitement of the NES! There's visual entertainment with the animated Rich Uncle Pennybags and Community Chest and Chance Cards, and the speedy sports car and other tokens that zoom around the board. Now listen for voice enhancemants such as the "jailer" who kicks Rich Uncle Pennybags out of Jail, and the digitized sound of the train whistles on the Railroad spaces. Like a real estate big shot, you let computer "accounting" keep track of your cash, assets, properties, houses and hotels. You can play with real, live real estate moguls, or take on the computer opponents, who might be beginners - or savvy big-time traders! The MONOPOLY game everyone grows up with, plus the NES... all in all, it's a real sweet deal!</Description>

		<Description>Thousands of history's famous monsters gather for the meeting of the century. But their volcanic convention center erupts, mysteriously turning them into terrors of pint-size proportions. They escape to the home of Jack, the teenage "Captain of Cool." There begins a battle between the good ghouls and The Warlock's band of evil beasts. You must become The Vampire or The Monster and lead the forces of right through a humongous, human-size world six levels deep, featuring Jack's house, a scummy sewer, a hazardous construction site, and an odd oriental palace. Don't get burned on the kitchen stove or crushed by runaway golf balls. Meanwhile you'll have to punch and zap at all your fiendishly favorite monsters including the head-rolling Skeleton, the rock candy throwing Goblin, the bone-crushing Cyclops, and dozens more! Every monster you mash is worth points. Score enough and you'll get an extra life. Something you'll really need when you finally face the powerful Warlock and his magic lightning jolts. So be a pocket-size peacemaker and conquer the smallest threat to monsterdom the world has ever known!</Description>

		<Description>You've gotta have a gimmick!


Prepare to meet your destiny. And put all your game playing skills to the test. Mr. Gimmick is a mystical, exhilarating, and very dangerous adventure that begins where all other games have ended. Violent enemies that suddenly become your ally, if you know the secret. Magical items hidden away in secret places that ensure your survival if you find them and prevent you from even finishing the game if you don't.


Mr. Gimmick's only weapon is a cosmic star with a potent form of energy you must harness. Master it, and the star can cripple your enemies, carry you over dangerous territory, and enable you to reach levels - and hidden places - that are unattainable to anyone but an expert.


Every game you played before has only prepared you for this ultimate challenge. You'll call on many skills, techniques, and tricks you've learned to help Mr. Gimmick survive this evil onslaught. Only the strong will survive. And only the very best will experience the secret ending.</Description>

		<Description>What would you think if your best friend went on a date with the King of the Dark World - because she thought he was cute?! You'd think she'd been duped - and you'd be right. The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! Yuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one - and you will control her. She is to become the greatest warrior in the universe, never suspecting that her most fearsome battle will not be  against a Dark Lord, but against her closest friend from the Human World - the one she warned, "Don't go out with him, he's the Dark..." But before she could finish, her friend ran off into The Darkness.</Description>

CPI, the Central Programing Institute, is what allows the world to exist the way it does. It controls everything; from global databases and grids to holographic theater software as well as the simple timing of the traffic signals. But something is terribly wrong tonight... cities around the globe have lost their power and data feeds. There have been several major aerial collisions between passenger liners and heavy freighters and the skyways have been closed until global traffic control is back on-line. All power and light have been lost and the atmospheric control system can only continue to function on auxiliary power for the verge of collapse. There is rioting reported in several areas. What's going on??? This appears to be more than a simple system's bug... but how much more?</Description>

		<Description>It's very simple... the NFL is football and this is the only officially licensed NFL game for the NES... the closest thing to "real" professional football that you can play without a helmet and shoulder pads. You can select any of the American and National Conference teams, and if you're good enough, you can take them all the way to the Super Bowl! Team rosters are broken down into positions and individually rated according to skills, with position upgrade packages, player ability handicapping, actual NFL Offensive and Defensive Playbook alignments with audibles and even variable wind direction and strength. You not only coach from the sidelines, you also control all the movements of the players on the field. Run, pass, catch, kick, punt, jump, tackle, block and dive... Refs even call penalties. No matter what kind of fan you are, whether you know the rulebook inside-out or just watch an occasional game on TV... this is the one football game you've got to have!</Description>

		<Description>Something frightening has been happening on Elm Street lately. It seems that with each waking day another grussome discovery is made... another neighborhood teen has mysteriously passed away into the dark stillness of the night. Everyone says it's "natural causes," but it seems as if something (or someone) has been picking them off one by one in their sleep. It's a horrible nightmare come true... and this nightmare has a name: Freddy Krueger.™

It's up to you and your remaining friends to search Elm Street for his bones, which have been scattered about then collect and burn them in the High School furnace. If you can just stay awake long enough, you might be able to end Freddy's™ reign of terror for good. You had better hurry though, it's getting late and you can feel your eyelids getting heavier and heavier by the minute.</Description>

		<Description>The shadows of doom grow long as the ancient Egyptian villain Sutekh envelops Metro City with a wave of crime. But Sutekh's seedy underworld is about to be infiltrated by a superhero unlike any the world has ever seen. A superhero who can melt into the darkness like a phantom. By day this brave new crimefighter is a common ordinary citizen. But when night falls, he is cloaked in a secret identity to seek out and destroy the dark forces that lurk on midnight streets. Who is this man the press calls Nightshade? Only you can answer that... for he is you! Every night you solidify your superhero status, patrolling 100 of the city's darkest corners. Here you'll find thieves, muggers, and other alley scum that you must either deal with or destroy for clues. But be warned. You're not the only night stalker. For as you hunt Sutekh, Sutekh hunts you with the human printing press, the closing wall of spikes, deadly jackal pits, and the chilling freeze ray. Of course the ultimate key to destroying Sutekh is your popularity. For it's a power source that gives you the wit to decipher clues and the strength to pulverize villains and rescue innocent bystanders. Remember, if this heroic prowess ever diminishes, you'll no longer control the night. You'll be consumed by it.</Description>

Othello is fast-paced, as easy to learn as checkers, yet as fascinating as chess. Play against a friend. Or play against the Othello computer in four challenging skill levels. You play the black discs and your opponent plays the white. Trap his discs between two of your own, and his "flip" to your color. One move can change the entire game. Finding that move is the secret to Othello. That's why it takes a minute to learn... but a lifetime to master!</Description>

Strategies are needed to meet the many challenges you will face as you strive to become a great leader. Farms need to be established to feed your growing populous. Taxes have to be imposed to raise money to build a stunning array of equipment... from a spy satellite to a hydroponic planet.

Even while you are establishing that delicate balance called life, a fiendish dictator is gazing at the whole universe with greedy eyes. He schemes to conquer and control. Confrontation is inevitable!</Description>

Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, the not-so-friendly ghosts, are dying to do some gobbling, too. Except their favorite food is PAC-MAN! His only defense is to eat the energizers, special pellets which enable PAC-MAN to gobble the ghosts - but only for a short while! And like all good ghosts, they come right back to haunt you. As you clear each maze, the ghosts move faster. Remember, it's a jungle out there. So gobble - or get gobbled!</Description>

You must collect all the diamonds and stash them safely in your igloo. Watch out! Those nasty seals have tusks as sharp as blades. If you can't crush them with a block of ice I suggest you dive out of their way.

Hang on! This is only round No. 1. Now let's try getting through to round No. 50. If you manage to get through all of that, how about constructing your own personal custom-tailored round. Good luck!</Description>

		<Description>Don't let the name fool you - Pinball Quest is much more than video pinball. In fact, it's the first-ever multi-screen fantasy in a pinball format! Every move you make tells a story; every shot takes you another step closer in your quest to rescue the captive princess of the castle. Along the way you'll meet ghosts, goblins, witches and demons, in an endless labyrinth of treacherous passages and deadly doorways. It takes a fearless heart and a fast mind to conquer Pinball Quest. It also takes the skills of a true pinball wizard... which you can hone on the three other video pinball games included on this cartridge! So before you pour any more money into your NES library, get the one title that's a library all by itself! No matter how hard you try, you can't get enough of Pinball Quest!</Description>

Well, it sounds easy enough, but the pace gets pretty hectic as the water stream picks up momentum. You may want to use a cross pipe, straight pipe, points pipe or try connecting a storage tank along the way to slow things down while you try and catch your breath.

		<Description>Modern warfare is no match for the fierce realism of six historically accurate severteenth century pirate raids along the Spanish Main. Aye, matey! That's why plundering and pillaging are back in style, as you command the role of a high seas high-jacker. Either an English Buccaneer, Dutch Adventurer, Spanish Renegade or French Explorer, each with a different skill level and strategic impact.

As a swashbuckling scoundrel, you'll barter with enemy merchants, trade for hidden treasure maps, negotiate with unscrupulous governors and forge alliances with monarchs who'd just as soon stab you in the back than float you a loan for new ships. Buth that's only half the battle! You'll also assault towns, sword fight with garrison commanders, lay siege to forts, and fire your cannons broadside at an armada of naval foes, including Spanish War Galleons, Dutch Frigates, French Merchantment and English Sloops.

Arrrrg, me swabby! Don't think it's all fun and destruction. Because if your bloodthirsty crew isn't hept happy boarding and burning enemy vessels, or if your navigation skills leave them shipwreched on a jagged Caribbean reef, they won't think twice about using you for shark bait. Fortunately, if events do take a nasty turn, you can save the statistical foot you've captured and return with a vangeance on another day.</Description>

		<Description>It's a reverse bulldog, a double nogin-knocker, a leap off the top turnbuckle - it's pure pandemonium! Welcome to the world of Nintendo Pro Wrestling, where you take on six of the meanest, baddest, most rotten guys around. With names like The Amazon, Giant Panther and Kin Korn Karn. You'll begin the match by choosing a wrestler and an opponent - either the computer or a friend. Then with a flick of the wrist you'll perform drop-kicks, body-slams, head-locks and dozens of other bone-crunching moves designed to annihilate your opponent. But be warned. Each wrestler has his own arsenal of back-breaking moves. Which means you'll have to think fast and move even faster to pin your opponent, hold him for a three-count, and become champion of Nintendo Pro Wrestling!</Description>

		<Description>No other baseball game gets you closer to playing in the big time than R.B.I. Baseball. Because every one of the ten teams in R.B.I. Baseball contains the rosters and player stats officially licensed from the MLB Players Association. Like real baseball, these skills and stats affect the outcome of every play. Like a real manager, you'll need to make good use of this vital information - and wise strategy decisions - if you want a winning record. R.B.I. Baseball is so intensely realistic, we've added amusing animation and a touch of humor to keep the action light-hearted and fun. You can play against the computer in a nine game season or compete against a friend in your own best-of-seven series. Stop playing with no-names and step up to the plate with real superstars in R.B.I. Baseball!</Description>

		<Description>RBI BASEBALL first set the standard as the only baseball game for play on the NES to use real players and their stats. RBI BASEBALL 2 raises the standard to a new level: You get all 26 pro teams, each with a roster of 24 real players. Every player comes with his actual 1989 stats. There's instant replay, as well as new and improved animation, graphics, music and sound effects to make the game come alive. As the manager, you get the designated-hitter rule, switch-hitting, and your own lineup of starters and subs. It's so great, it's approved by the Major League Baseball Players Association!</Description>

		<Description>After losing a confrontation against Super Commandos Mad Dog and Scorpion, the juices of destruction drip from the spiked tongue of the vile alien warmonger - Red Falcon. Now, he's coming back stronger than ever, with a sinister plan that includes having his intergalactic warriors seep into the brains of the U.S. Army. To support his disguised forces of doom, he's recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He's also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth's only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster. And if your spread guns, lasers, flame throwers and mega shells fail to destroy Red Falcon's eight levels of terror, including radioactive lava fields, it's all over but for the shouting, the screaming and the cries from a disintegrating world!</Description>

		<Description>No other baseball game gets you closer to playing in the big time than R.B.I. Baseball. Because every one of the ten teams in R.B.I. Baseball contains the rosters and player stats officially licensed from the MLB Players Association. Like real baseball, these skills and stats affect the outcome of every play. Like a real manager, you'll need to make good use of this vital information - and wise strategy decisions - if you want a winning record. R.B.I. Baseball is so intensely realistic, we've added amusing animation and a touch of humor to keep the action light-hearted and fun. You can play against the computer in a nine game season or compete against a friend in your own best-of-seven series. Stop playing with no-names and step up to the plate with real superstars in R.B.I. Baseball!</Description>

		<Description>RBI BASEBALL first set the standard as the only baseball game for play on the NES to use real players and their stats. RBI BASEBALL 2 raises the standard to a new level: You get all 26 pro teams, each with a roster of 24 real players. Every player comes with his actual 1989 stats. There's instant replay, as well as new and improved animation, graphics, music and sound effects to make the game come alive. As the manager, you get the designated-hitter rule, switch-hitting, and your own lineup of starters and subs. It's so great, it's approved by the Major League Baseball Players Association!</Description>

		<Description>The year is 2020 A.D. The evil drug kingpin Pitbull and his army of robots and brainwashed servants have crippled the law enforcement agencies of the world. You must seek out and destroy his communication and computer centers thus putting an end to his evil network of shipping and distribution. As you confront Pitbull's dealers and robotic "Cyborg" servants you will seize their drugs and money. The money will enable you to purchase the tools needed to overcome the obstacles in your path. Don't let the beauty of the streets fool you, for you are about to enter a world of laser beams, exploding mines and secret entrances. Engage your enemies as you traverse through the Pier, the Streets of Technopolis, and the Warehouse searching for clues. You will encounter more danger as you pilot a boat across the Swamp and travel through Space to an eventual confrontation with Pitbull himself in the Computer Center!</Description>

A single highly mobile raider might be able to carry out a surgical strike to the heart of The War Machine. Only a fighter pilot of enormous skill and courage could hope to neutralize all six Bungeling islands. Even as you strike at one island, robots repair the damage you've done, attacking again and again with a savage arsenal of destruction.

You are Rambo. Fallen hero. Once a decorated green beret; special weapons expert; master of the martial arts. Now, you're living in solitary, a prisoner of the government you swore to defend.


Intelligence sources believe they have discovered a hidden POW camp deep in the jungle. Your brothers in arms have been enslaved there for years. It's your choice: accept a suicide mission to find the camp, or spend the rest of your life in a 6' by 8' cell.


Your body is a weapon. Your mind, a disciplined machine. The most advanced military hardware is at your disposal, and a chopper waits to carry you to the drop site, where once again, you will be alone deep in hostile territory.


This is your war, Rambo. A war that will test your every skill. A war with only two possible results: freedom or death.


Armed and alone, you parachute into enemy territory.

Match courage and wits with the animals that rule the jungle.

Race to the landing site. It may be your only way to escape.

The objective is brutally simple: engage your enemy in an all-out exchange of cannonfire, then assess the damage and rebuild your castle. But the reality of RAMPART is far more complex. The key to victory lies in how quickly you can pick up the pieces and redesign, refortify, and extend your walls before the next battle begins. Whether you're facing an onslaught from the computer's armada, or pitting your castle cannons against another player's, there's only one way out. Defend... or perish.</Description>

		<Description>Oh, hi kids!


I'm so excited about my new invention - the Gametron 5000 Moneymaker. It pays you money for playing video games - the more you play, the more you make.


The first game is... let's see... Space Madness. Oh my, Space Commander Hoek has come down with Space Madness, and his spaceship is going to smash into the Earth! Luckily brave Space Cadet Stimpy (that's me!) is there to save the whole planet!


The next game is Out West, where Three-Fingered Hoek and his faithful sidesaddle, Stimpy the Kid (that's me again!) make their way through a dangerous frontier town to find Mr. Horse and... uh... borrow him.


And that's not it - heavens, no! The final game is Robin Hoek of Logwood Forest, where Robin robs from the rich, gives to the poor, and rescues the bea-u-ti-ful Maid Moron from atop yon castle...


Oh Reeennnn... are you ready to make oodles of money?


Money? Don't just stand there, man! Let's get playing!</Description>

		<Description>A diplomatic mission in a foreign city is seized by political fanatics. Innocent lives are in jeopardy. Outrageous demands are being made for their safety. Only you and your elite crisis intervention team can rescue the ambassador and his helpless staff. Position your sharpshooters around the embassy's perimeter. Focus your sights on the curtained windows. Squeeze off rounds of cover fire to protect your assault squad. Once your men are inside, an electronic diagram of the building's floor plan provides your only guide down to the captives - and the awaiting enemy. Look sharp. Stay frosty. Rescue is an interactive action-adventure game that lets you control each member of your strike team through three different game scenarios. Avoid searching spotlights, dodge enemy gunfire, rappel down walls, and smash through windows. Neutralize your adversaries and liberate the embassy personnel!</Description>

		<Description>A sadistic crime wave is sweeping through old Detroit. The situation is explosive - in fact, it is so bad, a private corporation, O.C.P., has assumed control of the police force. Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named RoboCop. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including RoboCop's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see RoboCop eliminated. Make your way past 6 levels of street thugs, Boddicker and the powerful ED-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play. It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of old Detroit - it's going to take RoboCop.

After his stunt plane was wrecked accidentally in a shootout between a couple of thugs and G-Men, the hoods had stashed an amazing stolen device in his cockpit. It didn't take long to figure out it was a rocketpack. And it took even less time for Cliff to become a target for half the city. The hoods wanted the stolen device back. So did its inventor, the famous, but eccentric American industrialist, not to mention the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the most menacing force of all, the Nazis! Even famous film star Neville Sinclair wanted the rocketpack. He had kidnapped Cliff's girlfriend, the gorgeous Jenny Blake, and was offering to exchange her for the device. Cliff had no time to ponder his desperate situation. There was only one course of action; he must become THE ROCKETEER!</Description>

		<Description>It's MEGA MAN versus the powerful leaders and fighting forces of Monsteropolis - that strange multi-layered land of robot-like humanoids created by the wrongly-performed experiments with human beings by Dr. Wily. Mega Man - the chosen defender of the human race. For he dares to single-handedly penetrate Monsteropolis' seven separate societies to stop the rapid expansion of strange misrepresentations of humans. Mega Man's goal is monumental. He must infiltrate seven separate heavily-guarded empires. By himself, he must break down and destroy the following empire leaders: Cutman, Gutsman, Iceman, Bombman, Fireman, Elecman, and Dr. Wily. The action involves Mega Man armed only with laser beam weapons, encountering strangely-configured humanoids. They're atop, in and out of fortified prison-like structures strengthened with thick walls. Hidden amid gun turrets embedded in concrete uprights, even in subterranean passages below icefields.

		<Description>Is nothing sacred? RollerGames, the 21st Century's most popular thrill sport, is the latest victim of V.I.P.E.R. (Vicious International Punks and Eternal Renegades). With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson "Skeeter" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner. You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles... through 6 stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous landslides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams. It's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball-bearings into bullets!</Description>

		<Description>Up for a little guerilla warfare? You asked for it. You're behind enemy lines, armed with only a knife and a mission: to free dozens of POWs hidden in an isolated, well-armored camp. If you're good, you'll pick off the heavily-armed enemy guerillas, one by one, and grab their bazookas and hand grenades. If you're great, you'll turn their weapons against them, to blow away a pack of attack dogs, a fleet of choppers, and a whole battalion of guards. But make one mistake, and it's all over. For you, our POWs... the future of the Free World!</Description>

		<Description>2 Great Games in One

Learning Fun with your Pals from Sesame Street


Game 1: Astro-Grover

Look up in the stars. It's Astro-Grover.

Help Grover in outer space as he has a close encounter with the friendly Zips from the planet Zap. Children count, add, and subtract Zips as they improve basic math skills. If they answer GROVER correctly, he will fly out to meet the Zips. In the case of a wrong answer, the Man-in-the Moon will shake his head and encourage the child to try again.


As children develop their number skills, a series of correct answers results in the building of GROVER's beautiful city or the launching of a zippy spaceship. Children are entertained for hours with colorful graphics and music that make learning fun!


Game 2: Ernie's Magic Shapes

With a wave of Ernie's wand, any child can make magic.

ERNIE invites children to join him on stage to practice matching shapes and colors as he presents challenging problems to solve.


Each time ERNIE magically creates a picture above his head, the child must consider its shape, size, and color. Each picture is composed of colored shapes in patterns that become more challenging through six levels of play. Shape by shape, children help ERNIE select the right one and make the incorrect one disappear! When the picture is complete, ERNIE's magic bunny jumps out to dance.</Description>

From the second you take command, you'll live by the motto FIND 'EM, CHASE 'EM, SINK 'EM, as you follow instruments, charts and your instincts in search of hostile convoys. Every decision you make will tempt fate, whether you risk a nighttime surface attack with deck guns blazing, or fire your last torpedo at a troop transport escorted by sub-killing destroyers. Your only relaxing moments away from the depth charges will come during torpedo and gunnery practice off the bomb ripped coast of Midway Island. So batten down your mental hatches.

But Krusty said it, so there's no way to deny it. My family and I get to go on this really cool worldwide Treasure Hunt - to China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood. And I need your help if I want to reach my final destination: a guest appearance on the Itchy and Scratchy Show. Here's the deal: I have to collect Krusty faces and Krusty products. The faces are worth bonuses and power-ups, and if I collect all the products I get a special reward. Wish me luck, man. I'm outta here. Your friend, Bart Simpson.</Description>

Three of these twisted trials are cut from the concrete courses of pro competitions. Each pits you head to head with a friend, shooting ramps or racing downhill, while going for rock n' rolls, hand plants, aerials, rail slides and methods! Then blast into "Mad Max on Wheels", dueling to the death with Bionic Lester, the dirtiest dude in the jam and joust. And finally "Skate and Destroy", a challenge that'll turn you into a Samurai skater, karate chopping your way through a tough alley filled with thugs, trash and unmentionable traffic hazards. So squirt a little oil onto your ball bearings, and prepare to Skate or Die!</Description>

		<Description>Welcome to Rodney's Winter Wonderland of tasty tournaments. A gnarly snow sport spectacular of five events - Snowboard Half Pipe, Snowball Blast, Inner Tube Thrash, Downhill Blitz, and Acro Aerials. Whether you're trying to win points or the judges' hearts, it's a torture test of slope-slicing skill for up to six skiers. But Rodney warns you the mountain's crawlin' with contest crashers like punk penguins, abnormal abominables, chainsaw-toting rabbits and bodacious polar bears. Frenzied freaks of nature who want you to cash it in on a snow bank. But buckle down and you'll rack up points for pulverizing all kinds of ski shack scum. Assuming, of course, you can swoosh past bear traps, trees and other ouch-inducing obstacles. And when you're not engaged in wild tubular warfare with twisted slope slime like Lester or the iglooheads, you must blind the keen-eyed judges with your brilliant backflips, ollies, pikes, hand plants, daffies and helicopters. Just stay cool while you hone your skills in practice or hot-dog it in competition. Because one bogus move and you'll be plowing the slope with your chin.</Description>

Unfortunately, your two best friends took the brunt of his frenzy and lost their fight to live. As nutty as ever, CaTaffy has sought asylum from the world's premiere bad guy - Higharolla Kockamamie. Grateful to this 'Rolla Radical, the Colonel has donated the biggest, baddest Ultra-Sheik Nuclear Attack Tank to his fellow madman's world dominating cause. Now your mission is to not only save Earth, but to inflict revenge. It's a job you'll definitely take personally as you infiltrate a nation of armed lunatics. Blow up a battleship. Hijack a train. Locate dozens of weapons and a truth serum that'll force enemy commanders to spill their guts. Then, destroy Vermon, Higharolla and the Earth Threatening Device with one lethal blow. All this, while staying in radio contact with a foxy spy named Jennifer and a Stealth copter pilot who'll be hovering nearby. So whaddaya think, Snake - are you commando enough to handle this Kockamamie scheme?</Description>

With a friend or by yourself, you can give the world's most famous beagle a big hand as he goes for the gold in six funny games filled with thrills and spills, giggles and wiggles.


The Sack Race is our first kooky contest. Ready, set, go! It's Snoopy and Spike hopping against the clock. Watch out! Those manhole covers could easily trip you up.


Now let's try the River Jump. Just fetch a long stick and vault over to the river's other side. Oops. Splash! Oh well, there's always another day and another event.


In fact, with four more games - Boot Throwing, Pogo Steeplechase, Overboard, and Pile of Pizza Race - and with its superior on-screen graphics and realistically rendered characters, there's serious fun for kids of all ages. (Alternative:... there's more fun here than a month of Sunday comics.)</Description>

A tremendous blunder in a warp experiment has created a rip in the fabric of space, catapulting the ship and crew across the galaxy beyond the Neutral Zone. The crippled ship must now boldly go back and repair the damage. Four spellbinding stages will take you on an energized adventure that transforms the look, the mood, the dialogue and the attitude of the original classic series from television to the NES!

Operate the photon torpedoes, hand phasers, tricorders, transporters, and whatever it takes to see that your Star Fleet arrives safely in the Final Frontier. You'll see familiar phrases and recognize scenes from your favorite Star Trek episodes when you beam down to vast unexplored planets, collect dilithium crystals, encounter nightmarish aliens and use the reasoning skills of a Vulcan to solve perplexing problems. Not any old terrestrial tourist can wear the Star Trek insignia on his shirt, so you must live up to the mighty tradition and make the Federation proud!

		<Description>Save The Earth From An Alien Snack Attack!


Man your battle stations! Dreaded alien bandits from the planet Attackon have kidnapped Professor Einstein J. Cinnamon - Super Genius.


The Attakons are scheming to zap the professor's brain, retrieving his secret bio-nuclear sweetener formula. A formula these evil-doers will use to transform Earth into an inter-galactic ball of cotton candy - a favorite munchie for Attackon sweet tooths. To save the world from this sticky fate, you'll soar into action in your highly advanced Stinger jet fighter, with its awesome array of wacky weapons.


But beware. From the beginning you'll be locked in dog-eat-dog dogfights, battling tooth and nail past Attackon defenses, from the South Seas to the Arctic Circle.


Then prepare for the ultimate challenge - the Attackon Fortress on the edge of space, where the professor is held hostage, and where Earth's survival rests on your shoulders.

		<Description>From deep within Mordroc's castle, a foul stench rose up to mix with the cold, damp midnight air; the telltale sign of the evil wizard's pet fire-breathing dragon, Singe; the reeking breath of the beast that guarded the Princess Daphne in the dark and deadly caves far below the surface. Dirk the Daring walked steadily toward the castle gate. He felt no fear. Fear was for cowards, not the most courageous knight in the land. No other would dare enter this perilous castle where Mordroc had imprisoned the helpless princess. But then, no other could match Dirk's unrelenting love for the beautiful Princess Daphne. There was no other possible course of action. Now was the time for heroes. Now was the time to enter the Dragon's Lair!</Description>

		<Description>Commandos Burn, Smith, Beans and Iron are a special forces team who have seen more than their fair share of action. Neo City is their post, now that a terrorist group known as D.N.M.E. is bombarding its citizens with a typhoon of a crime wave. The C-Force has been asked to stop them, no matter what. Take command solo or team up with a comrade in 2-player mode. Even if you go it alone, you can call on a backup soldier for spot support. Tap into your special forces training to devise unique battle plans and attack patterns, select weapons, and decide which soldier's individual strengths are best suited for the dirty deeds going down. You can switch commandos whenever the situation calls for it. Endure all 5 grueling missions, swarming with traps and terrorists, that take place in a warehouse, on a battleship, at a construction site, aboard a helicopter, and at C-Force headquarters. Encounter secret passageways, hidden rooms, aerial angle views and more. Every man is a walking arsenal with heavy-duty weaponry including rocket launchers, flame throwers, bazookas, rifles, land mines and time bombs. This mission is no cakewalk, but if it was, they wouldn't have given it to you. Hit it with all you've got!</Description>

One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horsehair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.

The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and return their normal selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King. Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of the great Koopa turtle king.

Mario, the hero of the story (maybe) hears about the Mushroom People's plight and sets out on a quest to free the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen Kingdom of the Mushroom People.

You are Mario! It's up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the Koopa!

		<Description>Join Pitfall Harry as he searches a vast subterranean cave dwelling high in the Andes. Harry's mission is simple - recover the Raj diamond. Interested in helping out? Perhaps a few details, before you volunteer. You'll have to be in great shape. The full extent of these caves is unknown, and you must be prepared to explore every square foot to succeed. So, a little dirt, a few cuts and bruises and total physical exhaustion doesn't scare you? OK, how about poisonous frogs, bats, snakes, scorpions, tarantulas, cavemen, lavapits and deadly condors? Oh, did we forget to mention Harry's niece, Rhonda, and his faithful companion, Quickclaw the Lion? They're both trapped below and must be saved before you leave the caves. Just a minor complication. Still with us? Good. Because it gets better and better - over 270 screens loaded with danger and adventure. New enemies and challenges at every turn. Sound like your cup of tea? Then step forward and join Pitfall Harry in the greatest adventure of his career!</Description>

		<Description>Carnivorous robots chow-down in China Town, while brutal Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly "Foot" Clan, bust-up bystanders from the Bronx to Broadway. Police SWAT Teams can't stop them, but the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles can! 'Cause, powered by slices of pizza, they're always ready to rumble - with nunchukus, Katana Blades, and a party bus loaded with Anti-Foot Clan Missiles. So team up with the turtles, Raphael, Leonardo, Michaelangelo and Donatello, then switch on the tortoise radar, following your map and sixth sense past savage traps and secret sewage passages. Knock heads with the nasty Ninjitsu and either splatter them senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup!</Description>

		<Description>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet "Stalking" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!</Description>

		<Description>In the era known as the Later Han, the people of China were plagued by a bandit horde called the Yellow Scarves. They searched for a hero that could amass a force strong enough to conquer these cutthroats and thieves. At that time, three men were separately gaining power by attaining the service of many Warlords. They each planned on ridding their country of the Yellow Scarves, but when that task is finished there will only be room for one Emperor. Return to a time of sword and honor, where an oath was signed in blood. Master the strategies in this role-playing game for the NES.</Description>

		<Description>TETRIS is a dynamic puzzle that seems easy enough: Rotate and flip moving geometric blocks into unbroken rows. When you completely fill up the bottom row, it disappears from the screen and your score rises. When enough rows vanish, the blocks descend faster and faster. Nothing to it, right? Wrong! When you can't find the way to make the pieces fit together and more blocks tumble down to clog your screen, you'll wish you had ten hands - and ten brains. Warning: Although TETRIS may be great food for thought, it's so much fun, it's positively addictive. So don't forget to eat something to fuel your body (maybe apple pie?).</Description>

You quickly spin, shift, and align the shapes then slide them in for a perfect fit. It's challenging and the pace is demanding. But satisfaction comes as you position each block neatly into place.

		<Description>In 306 B.C. Lou Ban, the most acclaimed artist of the Chin clan, sculpted from the finest ivory, 7 sets of enchanted Tiles. Legends say the original set of Tiles was created by gods and played as a game. Wizards said when played by mortals, it was an art that could be used to predict the future. Priests said it was a dangerous gamble that actually altered the flow of fate. Soon the art of the Tiles had spread across the whole of China, but with it something strange was also spreading. Droughts and then flooding, terrible famines and then gigantic harvests. Everyday something more strange and unlikely would occur, the forces of fate had indeed been blown out of control. The influence of the Tiles on the land of China had to come to an end, but it would not be easy. Like the force of Yin &amp; Yang, each Tile has a match that when united, will allow both Tiles to achieve symmetry, and simply cease to exist. You must conquer 7 castles to defeat 7 sets of Tiles. It will take more than quick reflexes - you must use strategy, skill and luck to defeat the TILES OF FATE!</Description>

		<Description>ACME ACRES IS IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE!


"Welcome to my new Fun Land," a friendly voice shouts, as all of Acme Acres rushes inside the gate of the gigantic new amusement park. But soon they realize this is no ordinary, run-of-the-thrill theme park. This is WACKYLAND, a prankster packed park owned and operated by Montana Max, their arch villain who has cleverly disguised himself as a nice guy.


Suddenly Plucky Duck is stuck behind the wheel of the world's bumpiest bumper car. Hamton is riding a wild west train, dodging obstacles and enemies. Furrball is hanging on for his nine lives atop a high speed log ride. Babs Bunny's stomach is doing flip flops as she hip hops from one crazy roller coaster car to another. And Buster Bunny is lost in a funhouse maze that's turning his life upside down. Think this is amusing? No doubt! In fact, it's a hare-splitting adventure that'll crack you up as you jump aboard five wild n' weird rides that'll throw you for a loopdy-loop.


Hang onto your ears - there's more! Like Roderick Rat, Batsy, Arnold the Pit Bull and Elmyra, four foes who will give you nothing but trouble. Shirley The Loon, a hard-nosed ticket taker who won't let you ride the next ride if you're too short (on points). And dozens of traps that are stickier than cotton candy. All in all, it's like five great games in one. Making Wacklyand today's biggest attraction for your NES.</Description>

		<Description>Deep in the jungles of Mexico lie the ancient Mayan tombs of Chichen Itza. Eternal resting place of kings - and the vast treasure that was buried with them, including the legendary Sun Key. Now a famous archaeologist has vanished there, leaving behind only a tattered notebook that speaks not just of treasure, but of the bloodthirsty demons that guard it. And with the notebook, the legacy of treasure and terror has passed to you... Can you penetrate the heart of the mystery, and find the mythical Sun Key? Or will the tombs of Chichen Itza claim you among the dead?</Description>

		<Description>TOOBIN' IS TOTALLY TUBULAR!


Wanna be a real party animal? Then, you just gotta play Toobin'! It's the most fun anyone can have on an inner tube!

You and a buddy can take turns paddling down a prehistoric swamp, jostling with dinosaurs and cavemen.

Or cruise down some modern city river where you'll try to evade nasty punks and slimy industrial sludge (ugh, real barfo!)

If that isn't far-out enough, then float down some Martian canals - where the water's purple and everything's really out of this world!

These are just examples, dudes. Toobin's got so many places to tube around, it'll blow your mind.

So jump in, the water's totally rad and bad!</Description>

		<Description>The sun shimmers on the horizon as your armed-to-the-teeth Navy fighter screams from the carrier deck, accelerating into the danger zone. High above hostile waters your mission is to defend the task force from enemy attack. Suddenly, bogeys flash onto your radar. They're everywhere, diving toward you at Mach 2. Only a second to react, you go to guns and arm missiles. Your heart pounds and palms sweat as you blast into the dogfight with cannons blazing. Tracers zip past your engines. Shells shatter your senses. Now it's just you against them. And to survive you'll need more than speed and firepower. You'll need guts and instinct. You'll need to be a "TOP GUN" pilot!</Description>

		<Description>Play the game of your dreams with Top Players' Tennis - the only game where you "become" Ivan Lendl or Chris Evert.


But first, you've got four major tournaments to play; the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Play singles against a friend, or the computer; double up with Lendl or Evert to beat the computer; or play with a friend against the computer. There's excitement, action and sweat as you play game... set... match - and win!


Top Players' Tennis gives you total command of the ball. Hit a passing shot cross-court or down-the-line; play deep from the baseline; serve and volley or take the game with an overhead smash. You set the speed of the serve and the spin on the ball, giving it a top spin, slice, drop shot or side spin - just like the pros. When you're ready, hit a "Miracle shot," where the ball can zig-zag or soar right up in the air!


While you play, Evert and Lendl are by your side, with adviCe at the touch of a button. So put yourself on the court with a pro. With Top Players' Tennis, the only thing between you and the Grand Slam is...you!</Description>

Now the wimpy nerd Melvin has mutated into Toxie, a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength. But all is not lost. Toxie, with his newfound power, has joined forces with Major Disaster, Nozone, Headbanger, and Junkyard to form the Toxic Crusaders. No, not the ultimate heavy metal band, you moron! This motley crew is sworn to defend Tromaville and the rest of the U.S. from the polluting ways of Dr. Killemoff and his Radiation Rangers!

		<Description>Get ready for racing action like you've never experienced it. Because Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing is so much more than just a game you drive.

An entire racing season on the world's 16 toughest tracks lies ahead. Each demands its own strategy; Al Jr. will give you advice before every race. In the pusuit of the season's championship, you can set up and modify your own car, or climb behind the wheel of Little Al's maxxed-out machine.

A heartbroken, Hollywood "Toon" star is accused of murdering one of the most popular men in town. The same man who was, just 24  hours earlier, seen playing "pattycake" with our star's lovely and  mysterious wife. It's an open and shut case, right? WRONG!


This is where your job begins. You must search high and low through downtown Los Angeles, the City Park, the Warehouse District and  even ToonTown looking for clues to help Eddie prove that Roger is  innocent. You have to unearth all four pages of Marvin's missing  Will that will guarantee ToonTown's future forever. At the same  time, you must also keep the Weasels from getting Roger, protect  Jessica from the dreaded Dipmobile and help Eddie stay out of jail.  As if that's not enough, you must collect the right weapons, accessories  and facts that will enable you to defeat Judge Doom in the final confrontation.


You'll have to call up all of your game playing and super-sleuth detective abilities to get you through this one... And there's still  no guarantee. In the end, the joke could be on you.</Description>

		<Description>Are you ready to step into the world of Wizardry? Unmatched by any other fantasy role-playing game, the Wizardry Gaming System allows for unlimited combinations of strategies and tactics, so that each quest into the Maze is always fresh and interesting.

Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first Wizardry scenario. Starting in the Castle, you assemble one to six adventurers to explore the magic and mystery of the ten-level 3-D Maze. Your characters may be one of five races and eight professions, each with strengths and weaknesses.

Under your command, brawny warriors, frail magis, pious clerics, and nimble thieves accumulate experience and treasure. As your characters gain experience, they develop greater capabilities to become even better adventurers, allowing them to venture deeper into the Maze.

Be wary! The treacherous Maze has some tricks and traps of its own. Hundreds of monsters, many with magical powers equal to your own; pits; chutes; rotating rooms; teleporters; special one-of-a-kind surprises; and much more will keep you on your toes for many hours of fun. May luck and good fortune be your companions!</Description>

A wizard so great, Merlin calls him teacher. But Malkil has strayed from the path, and is now part of the dark side. Buried within the catacombs and dungeons of Elrond lies the key to your quest. The powers of levitation, the cloak of darkness, and the mysterious potions only Kuros can drink will be revealed to you. In caverns of fire, through demons that fly and crawl, against the soldiers of the undead you must continue. No sorcery can prevail, for you are the only knight with the strength to wield the Brightsword. The prisoner of the wizard awaits. She calls to you from Castle IronSpire.

		<Description>When Kuros last did battle with the Evil Wizard Malkil atop Icefire Mountain, he raised his Ironsword in triumph and glory... or so he thought. Suddenly, a powerful bolt of magic has robbed Kuros of his armor, memory, and honor. But the distant presence of evil stirs in his mind, leading him to the once fair city of Piedup, the very same place where the villainous soul of Malkil survives. Without his armor, Kuros will need crafty disguises to travel undetected, ready to do battle as a wizard, nobleman or thief. His quest will take him from the depths of the dungeon to the palace containing riches beyond belief - building strength, perfecting fighting skills and acquiring rare knowledge of magic along the way. The time has come for Kuros to turn his visions of power... into reality!</Description>

It's a game you design, a game where everything - from the pit crew to the power boost, from the suspension to the speed, right down to the color of the racing machine itself - is in your control.

An entire racing season on the world's 16 toughest tracks lies ahead. Each demands its own strategy; Al Jr. will give you advice before every race. In the pusuit of the season's championship, you can set up and modify your own car, or climb behind the wheel of Little Al's maxxed-out machine.

Great graphics. Astounding action. If you're into racing, Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing puts you into it like no other game around!</Description>

		<Description>Play the game of your dreams with Top Players' Tennis - the only game where you "become" Ivan Lendl or Chris Evert.


But first, you've got four major tournaments to play; the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Play singles against a friend, or the computer; double up with Lendl or Evert to beat the computer; or play with a friend against the computer. There's excitement, action and sweat as you play game... set... match - and win!


Top Players' Tennis gives you total command of the ball. Hit a passing shot cross-court or down-the-line; play deep from the baseline; serve and volley or take the game with an overhead smash. You set the speed of the serve and the spin on the ball, giving it a top spin, slice, drop shot or side spin - just like the pros. When you're ready, hit a "Miracle shot," where the ball can zig-zag or soar right up in the air!


While you play, Evert and Lendl are by your side, with adviCe at the touch of a button. So put yourself on the court with a pro. With Top Players' Tennis, the only thing between you and the Grand Slam is...you!</Description>

		<Description>Join Major Rock Hardy and Captain Ace Gunn in their battle for supremacy against an army of invading Xybots! With a split-screen for one or two players and a unique viewing area, you'll find Xybots a challenging strategic blast-'em-up! It's non-stop action all the way and working together in two-player mode is the ultimate fun. Each player controls one character and the split-screen gives each his own playing area. A map shows the section you're battling through and the positions of the patrolling Xybots. And to keep one step ahead, pick up energy pods, super weapons, keys and coins.</Description>

		<Description>IF YOU LIKE FIGHTING DIRTY, YOU'RE GONNA DIG ZEN!


The greatest environmental disaster in human history is about to hit your backyard. But you're not backing down, because you're Zen, a cold-blooded Ninja warrior who's come to Earth to clean the clock of Lord Contaminous and his crud-loving cronies.


But wasting these slimeballs won't be easy. Because they'll spew forth the most hazardous graphics ever to wreak havoc on your NES. We're talking horizontal, vertical and 3/4 view scrolling that will give you a whole new perspective on acid rain, oil spills and ozone-ravaging smog. And wait till you see the fluid character movements. They're hotter than a uranium-oozing nuclear meltdown!


There are 12 total levels, each with its own ecological enemies, toxic traps and pollution-fighting objectives. You'll battle oil rig fires, trying to save trapped workers. Use your Photon-Stick to zap gaseous garbage men on a high-speed plutonium mining car ride. Vertical jump through two separate screens to reach a venomous vixen who's single-handedly scorching the rainforests. And spin kick Smogger, a smoked-out scum of the Earth.


Finally, try to survive a rescue mission stage. Rack up points in the bonus recycling level. And slash through 6 subgames that will lead you to the feet of Lord Contaminous, who you must dispose of before he trashes every living thing on the face of the Earth.

		<Description>1999. What appeared to be a harmless meteorite crashing in the Nevada desert has turned out to be Darc Seed, an evil alien creature with horrible powers. By shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work. These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil clutches of Darc Seed.</Description>
