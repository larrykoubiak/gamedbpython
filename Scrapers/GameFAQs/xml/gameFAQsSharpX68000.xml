Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves, bats - creatures lurking around every corner. As you descend deeper and deeper, they get thicker and thicker. Better stick close to the cavern floor - it's your only chance of finding a weapon or two. You're gonna need 'em. Because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the jugular. So keep your courage up and your stake sharp. And say your prayers!</Description>

		<Description>Become Genghis Khan and lead the most fearsome army in the known world. Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</Description>

		<Description>Drift back to ancient Phoenicia and challenge yourself with Columns, a game favored by middle eastern merchants. In this mesmerizing pastime, tinker with your riches to align glittering jewels across, down, or diagonally. As you line up colors, the gems vanish and more sparklers drop from above. The challenge increases as the jewels fall more rapidly. You must quickly align them before the columns reach the top. Imagine yourself on the warm Mediterranean coast, or drifting over a languid sea. Forget the passage of time, and tickle your mind with Columns, the brilliant game of strategy and skill.</Description>

		<Description>The time is yesteryear, when knights scoured the countryside in search of the Holy Grail, defended the honor of fair maidens and fought a never-ending battle against rampant evil forces. Thrown into this mayhem, is the courageous Sir Arthur. A victorious knight with the awesome task of penetrating the Demon's Castle to pulverize the Prince of Darkness. Can he do it? It's up to you. You'll dangerously travel through the Place of Execution, the Village of Decay, the Town of Fire, and the Crystal Forest with an arsenal of weapons at your side. And when you're really down on your luck, magic fights might with powerful results. The only problem? You'll have to learn how to use it. And avoid it. Because their magic has the power to change you into a helpless duck among other things. But there's not much time. Lives depend on you. So brandish your sword and make mincemeat of your foes.</Description>

		<Description>No heroes. No foes. Just skill and technology are all that's needed to complete the optical circuits of DEFLEKTOR. It's an experience in laser logic. Guide your laser beam around each screen. Reflectors, refractors, mirrors, absorbers, polarizers and fiber optics are your basic apparatus. Your precise judgment of the angles and paths of your high-intensity laser are the only means by which your beam can be directed towards the home receiver. DEFLEKTOR is frustratingly compulsive, amazingly cunning... but above all it's unbelievably addictive!</Description>

		<Description>Are you clever enough to solve an evil wizard's twisted puzzles? Do you possess the concentration needed to explore a labyrinth of mystery? Should you resist the tempting treasures, defeat the hideous monsters, and escape the devious traps that are hidden throughout the Grey Lord's dreadful dungeon?
Yes? Then perhaps you'll be the one to enter the caves of the sacred mountain and retrieve the Firestaff from the evil Lord Chaos. To succeed, you must assemble a band of four champions and lead them in fierce battles against the terrible Dark Lord who now rules your master's dungeon.
And if you fail? At best, you'll meet your ghastly end in the dungeon's wretched catacombs, like hundreds of brave adventurers who went before you. Far worse, you might become a captive "trophy" of the evil Lord Chaos, suspended forever in the haunting mirrors of the Hall of Champions.</Description>

		<Description>You're really up against it this time. These revolting robots have finally upped and turned their horribly powerful weapons on their kind human masters. Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand... I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out the mess? You guessed - you get the job. Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment and time is running out.</Description>

		<Description>Mankind struggles to survive! Without warning they came... And laid waste to the moon and man's bases on it. Ill-prepared and outgunned, Earth scientists worked feverishly to build a weapon to turn the tide. The "OF-1" is the ultimate fighter. Even as the crews prepare to fight, industrial and military space complexes disappear, one by one. Viewing screens, hooked to spy satellites, flash images of unidentified fighter attacks and a strange vegetation coiling itself around the moon's computer like an insidious serpent. Victory will come only to the worthy. Are you?</Description>

		<Description>It couldn't be simpler. You get pieces of different sizes and shapes. One by one you put them down on the playing board - soon you've made your first loop. Yeaaaah! Now it's not so easy. This time you didn't get the pieces you wanted. Never mind - just start another loop. All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life). Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A). Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about LOOPZ. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record. Will LOOPZ drive you crazy? You bet!</Description>

		<Description>One day, our octopus friend gets into a fight to the death with his old rival, the bug. Our octopus wins and people start to call him Mr. Parodius. On his paid vacation he goes to the countryside to enjoy a little farming. Returning to our ready-made octopus pot, he reads the "People of the Universe" newspaper and nearly falls off his chopping board in surprise. There now is a picture of the mysterious Great Octopus with the Earth in his arms. "F... father?," he stutters. It was his father, who had disappeared just two years before, never to return home. So Octopus sets out on a search for the truth and with his companions begins to travel the world!</Description>

With a mortifying rain of bionic block patterns descending upon you, you race back and forth in your powerful Blockbuster ship obliterating the blocks before they blow you to kingdom come.

And if you chalk up enough points to qualify, you'll charge into bonus games where it's you against the clock and the unstoppable blocks of QUARTH. So, ace, if you think you've got the steady hands of a brain surgeon, the sharp eye of an eagle, and the steely nerves of a Hollywood stuntman, power up QUARTH. And see if you can outlast the blockbusting action!</Description>

		<Description>You've saved the innocent people of Gradius from the vile Bacterions. But now an even deadlier plague has slimed into the neighborhood. It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you!</Description>

		<Description>At some point in the distant future (in present terms, the 31st century), the human race perfected the bio-logic circuit and created a master computer called the Gatefold Computer System, or GCS-WT. The computer took in information at a fantastic rate and became "self-aware" just a few days after going on-line.

Seeing itself as superior to humans, it immediately gave the inhabitants of Earth an ultimatum: Be ruled or be destroyed. The humans fought GCS-WT and most of their forces were defeated. A small group, however, managed to escape and regroup on a secret base near the star Sirius.

These last members of the resistance movement have used all their technical know-how to assemble the most powerful spacefighter ever. With the speed and weaponry of this ship, the resistance fighters believe that they can break through the defenses of GCS-WT and destroy it.

But the spacefighter is no good without a pilot . . .</Description>

		<Description>Eighteen years ago the planet Nebula was attacked by the Lone Star System, arch enemy of the Interplanetary Federation. Its population decimated, the few survivors swore to protect its future with their lives. That time has come. Docked in the space portal of the planet Nebula, sits the combat weapon fortress Plealos, mother ship of the Lone System's fleet. What she can't take, she'll destroy. Now's your opportunity to use your sophisticated combat skills and save your planet. You're Ryder Jupiter. Known as Ace to the Federation, you've got vengeance on your mind. And the only person you trust in battle is the faithful Diana Rean, a bold determined comrade. What brings you together is the tyrant Reficul, Emperor of Lone. His plans to dominate Nebula can only be thwarted with the power of Thunder Force II which must be jettison deep below the planet's surface to Plealos for the final confrontation. Here you'll rely on the molecular Excelizer, a blast so strong it leaves nothing behind but memories. Go forth brave one, and free the entire Federation of Reficul forever.</Description>

		<Description>Prepare yourself for a grand adventure: Ultima IV, sixteen times larger than Ultima III, is a milestone in computer gaming. Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>
