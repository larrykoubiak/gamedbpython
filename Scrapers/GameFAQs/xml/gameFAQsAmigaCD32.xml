		<Description>Sinbad Junior works for the "fair and just" Caliph as an apprentice gardener tending to his incredibly excessive palace gardens. Today however he gazes upon another beautiful flower - the Princess Laila as she stands on a balcony high above the gardens.
Away in an eerie floating castle dark deeds are at hand. The evil Vizier, in his dastardly plan to rule the kingdom, has despatched a demon from the nether regions of hell to kidnap the princess and cast a mighty spell over the kingdom.
As Sinbad stares up at the balcony a dark shape descends from the sky, mauling and clawing at Laila.
Laila screams and the demon lifts off clutching the beautiful princess. Sinbad makes a desperate leap to grab the claw of the monster, but is left on the balcony flat on his back. As the demon disappears into the clouds Sinbad is surrounded by the Caliph's guards and hurled into prison on a charge of sorcery. Now, taking on the role of Sinbad Junior, you not only have to escape the palace dungeons, but also rescure Laila from the evil Vizier.</Description>

		<Description>Sometime during the last century, an experimenter with time, space and early computers created a bizarre machine. The inventor's name was Baron Fortesque. The machine was... The Chaos Engine. Although primitive, the machine became incredible powerful and went crazy, turning ordinary humans and household pets into razor toothed, armour-plated killing machines. Enter 6 hard-nailed mercenaries for hire. These ball-breakers are armed to the teeth with over 25 weapons and a host of special destructive devices specific to their class. Select 2 characters to form your party and enter the World of Chaos. The sprawling adventure covers 4 graphic worlds and 16 levels loaded with fiendish traps, puzzles and secret passages. Get your hands on sawn-off shotguns, molotov cocktails and a huge amount of armament, and buy, blag or blast your way through hordes of different monsters to do battle with the ultimate killing machine, THE CHAOS ENGINE!</Description>

		<Description>Darkseed is based upon the fantastic artwork of swiss surrealist H.R. Giger, the inspiration for such blockbusters as Alien, Alien 3 and Poltergeist II. Giger has revolutionised the look of Science Fiction forever with his unique "biomechanical" style which depicts the synthesis of technology and biology as they might evolve without the influence of man.
Challenge your mind... You are Mike Dawson, a Science Fiction writer who just purchased an old victorian house. As you explore your new home, you soon discover that you have bought more than you bargain for.
Control the fate of two worlds... The world as we know it and the dark world of an ancient and dying civilisation. Unlock the secret of a sinister plot and discover the dark passage to their world... A place more terrifying than your darkest nightmare.
Time is running out... You are on a collision course with destiny and only you have the ability to save yourself and the world from a cruel and inhuman fate. Every decision may be your last, so choose wisely... All of humanity is depending on you.</Description>
