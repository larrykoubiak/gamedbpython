		<Description>Battlestations: Midway offers a totally new approach to air, sea and underwater combat, accurately reflecting the atmosphere and situation in the Pacific during 1942. Players take direct control of battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines and planes in a 'free-control' environment, with seamless switching between any of the units under your command: engage in dogfights with enemy fighters through flak-infested skies, utilise the silent attack of your submarine to unleash torpedoes on unsuspecting enemies, or command the awesome firepower of an entire carrier group. Featuring a number of game modes, including single-player campaigns for both Japanese and American sides, 'career' missions focusing on specific units, and broadband multiplayer modes for up to 16 people, Battlestations: Midway is a game on the grandest scale, bringing the air and sea battles of the Pacific to life like never before.</Description>

		<Description>The year is 2026 and fatal toxins have polluted the earth's atmosphere. Those humans lucky enough to get to the "Climate Emulation Centers" in time live in fear of the souls left on the surface - mutated, blood-thirsty zombies - the "undead." The World Government has recruited drivers to deal with this problem. The solution is "The Carmageddon" - a death race in which drivers race against each other for the ultimate prize: a new life on the sun-drenched beaches of the off-world colonies. As well as a way of dealing with the zombies, it provides entertainment for the dwindling human population. You take on this challenge as Max Damage, a psychotic, cold-blooded racing machine. There is no second place. Drive to survive and let nothing and no one get in your way!</Description>
