		<Description>Donkey Kong is at it again! This time he's loose in the greenhouse. And he's got company: a swarm of very pesky bees! It's up to you to get Donkey Kong out of the greenhouse and exterminate the bees... without hurting the flowers. But that's easier said than done! Because Donkey Kong has plenty of coconuts to hurl at you, and those bees know just where to sting you so it hurts. But, if you keep your wits about you, you'll score lots of points and have lots of laughs in the best Donkey Kong of them all... DONKEY KONG 3!</Description>

		<Description>What would you think if your best friend went on a date with the King of the Dark World - because she thought he was cute?! You'd think she'd been duped - and you'd be right. The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! Yuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one - and you will control her. She is to become the greatest warrior in the universe, never suspecting that her most fearsome battle will not be  against a Dark Lord, but against her closest friend from the Human World - the one she warned, "Don't go out with him, he's the Dark..." But before she could finish, her friend ran off into The Darkness.</Description>

Lord British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character. The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits...</Description>

		<Description>Are you ready to step into the world of Wizardry? Unmatched by any other fantasy role-playing game, the Wizardry Gaming System allows for unlimited combinations of strategies and tactics, so that each quest into the Maze is always fresh and interesting.
Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first Wizardry scenario. Starting in the Castle, you assemble one to six adventurers to explore the magic and mystery of the ten-level 3-D Maze. Your characters may be one of five races and eight professions, each with strengths and weaknesses.
Under your command, brawny warriors, frail magis, pious clerics, and nimble thieves accumulate experience and treasure. As your characters gain experience, they develop greater capabilities to become even better adventurers, allowing them to venture deeper into the Maze.
Be wary! The treacherous Maze has some tricks and traps of its own. Hundreds of monsters, many with magical powers equal to your own; pits; chutes; rotating rooms; teleporters; special one-of-a-kind surprises; and much more will keep you on your toes for many hours of fun. May luck and good fortune be your companions!</Description>
