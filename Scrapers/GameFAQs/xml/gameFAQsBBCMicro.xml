		<Description>This is the sequel to the infamous Atari® classic, Asteroids® where you must blast all the asteroids to pieces in the given time. Sounds familiar but this time there are deadly enemies such as UFOs and Killer Satellites, which will chase and shoot at you as you try to complete your quest. Use your shield to protect you against a fatal collision but use it sparingly as this shield will deplete every time your ship is hit. Help is at hand in the form of pickups, which will emerge from the debris of the destroyed asteroids. They can give you more blasting power and provide you with extra time to cope with the onslaught of attacks.

Asteroids® Deluxe™ contains all the action of the original and more with new and improved graphics, faster game play, dangerous enemies and as much master-blasting fun as you can handle. You only have 3 lives and a limited time - use it well!</Description>

Ballistix just explodes with excitement, puzzles and an amazing 130 different screens of frenetic action! The aim of the game is simple: score more goals than your opponent to win the match. Doing it is a different matter as splitters fill the screen with dozens of balls, tunnels hide them from view, bumpers bounce balls all over the show, fiendish red arrows speed them up to almost impossible velocity, magnets pull them away from your control, and much, much more. You can play against the computer or another player, set the speed if you can't stand the pace, define where the balls are fired and their velocity, rack up bonuses that will get you extra goals and then, at the end of an exhausting game, set your name in pride of place on the high-score table.</Description>

You must penetrate his stronghold, avoid his human-seeking robots and find the pieces of the security code. Somersault over the robots or use a precious snooze code to deactivate them long enough to search each room.

		<Description>Depending on your skill, confidence and courage, you have the choice of remaining near the landing pad, learning to hover and land, or venturing higher to practice your approaches. When you think you have mastered these, then accelerate the Jump Jet into an attack fighter. Use the radar and range finder to seek and destroy the enemy by launching heat-seeking, air-to-air missiles. Beware! His radar and missile systems are as good as yours. Reckless pursuit is ill-advised; you must maintain a fuel level that will enable you to relocate and return to the aircraft carrier, executing the skills you have learned to achieve a successful landing.</Description>

		<Description>It couldn't be simpler. You get pieces of different sizes and shapes. One by one you put them down on the playing board - soon you've made your first loop. Yeaaaah! Now it's not so easy. This time you didn't get the pieces you wanted. Never mind - just start another loop. All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life). Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A). Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about LOOPZ. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record. Will LOOPZ drive you crazy? You bet!</Description>

On the second and third levels you control Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian as he flies the Millenium Falcon. Lando flies close to the Death Star fighting off a mighty attack from TIE Fighters. The Millenium Falcon enters the Death Star and travels down a dangerous corridor towards the central reactor. Blast the reactor and then turn around to get away from the Death Star as it blows up!</Description>

		<Description>Strike Force Harrier puts you in the cockpit for a full flight and combat simulation of one of Britain's most exciting fighter aircraft. Your objective is to bomb the enemy HQ, at the same time defending yourself and your ground sites from enemy aircraft and ground forces. You have cannon, bombs, and Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles at your disposal - but the enemy is just as well-armed as you are. You can select either practice or combat level, with a skill level of pilot, commander or ace. At the end of each mission your score is given, calculated on the basis of your distance from the enemy HQ.</Description>

		<Description>SPRECO (the SPace REfuse COllector) returns to Homebase Five from escaping the castle after the lightning accident that sent him there. But the complex was deserted totally devoid of all life. From a nearby Construct-bot, SPRECO finds out that the humans had been enslaved and the complex taken over by an evil being calling himself "The Mindmaster". In order for SPRECO to destroy him he has to find the experimental DeActi-Unit, which the Mindmaster has split up into 4 sections and hidden throughout the complex. SPRECO would have to find these parts, take them to the Mindmaster's hiding place, piece it together and re-activate the unit in order to free the people from the Mindmaster's control.</Description>
