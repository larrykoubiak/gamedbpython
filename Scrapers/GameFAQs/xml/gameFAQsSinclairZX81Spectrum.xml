		<Description>This software package contains two cassettes of the main programs in the NEC course 30 Hour BASIC Spectrum edition. The tapes are prepared for use with a Spectrum micro only.
Tape 1 contains 36 programs covering the first steps of learning BASIC up to and including FOR... NEXT loops and strings. The program include simple arithmetic, temperature conversions, percentages, compound interest, printing standard letters, making a telephone directory, a simple quiz, putting items in order, counting and producing frequency distributions.
Tape 2 contains 34 programs using more advanced techniques of BASIC than on Tape 1. These include random number generations and mathematical functions. The programs include: simulating coin tossing and dice throwing, calculating means, squares, cubes and reciprocals, sorting a list into alphabetical order, and simple games.
Although the two tapes in this pack are specially prepared for use with 30 Hour BASIC, they form a first-class introduction to BASIC even if you do not have 30 Hour BASIC itself.</Description>

		<Description>You can design a car, house, aeroplane (or whatever you want!) and then walk around it. See what it looks like from any angle. Change it. Add color, detail, animation. The possibilities are endless. And it's ideal for creating games. If you're not artistic, don't worry - there are lots of objects already included in the kit for you to use in your plans, but it's simple to create your own if you want. So, if you enjoy playing games, but want to use your computer's real capabilities for a change, this is a perfect opportunity.</Description>

		<Description>After an incident on 61 Cygnus in 2197 when a rookie pilot selected the wrong gear when docking with the main central reactor and reduced half the planet to molten lava. Gal-Corp decided that a special training facility was needed to provide an elite corps of pilots for the advanced military Skimmers used in colonisation and reconnaisance work.
The Galcorp Academy for Advanced Skimmer Pilots (GASP) was founded in 2213 to meet the requirement. With an intake of over a hundred would be skimmer pilots a year, only a few meet the exacting requirement of flying and combat skills.
It order to graduate from the Academy cadets must complete 20 mission, grouped in five levels of four, successfully.
With Skimmer Design, environmental assimilation and near perfect Combat Skills, Graduates are the finest of the few.</Description>

		<Description>There's a board. There are pieces with varying powers, squares to move into and an opponent to conquer. But the squares keep changing. And once you decide where to attack, the board explodes into a battlefield. Your pieces include phoenixes, golems and wizards, and they use all their strange powers when they fight the banshees, goblins and sorceresses they face. They cast spells and missiles, they pummel, pierce and throw out flames, they move each other around, take on each other's shapes and shriek at each other. If you square off on a spot that stays favorable, you'll be hard to kill. If you're smart, fast, dextrous and farsighted, you may win. If you're not, look for another game.</Description>

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</Description>

		<Description>You are Marty McFly, just a typical senior at Hill Valley High. But after getting behind the wheel of a nuclear-powered sports car turned time machine, you find yourself in the year 1955 where you've accidentally tampered with history. Now it must be corrected. You must somehow make sure that teenagers Lorraine Baines and George McFly (the two kids that will eventually grow up to become your parents) fall in love before the photo of your family fades away and you're left with nothing to come home to. It won't be easy. You'll have to protect George from Biff and his gang of bullies while doing your best to keep them from beating you up instead. To complicate things, Lorraine has a crush on you, so you'll have to dodge her advances while trying to figure out a way to get George and her to kiss at the school dance. Time is wasting and even if you manage to put all of the pieces in place, there is still no guarantee that you'll get back. It will all come down to one brief moment in time when the past, present and future all meet.</Description>

		<Description>A Sphere is so perfect that it is almost a solidified concept. It can be as light as a bubble or as destructive as a bomb.
Ball Breaker is an arena, a place where a sphere is at its most powerful and destructive.
The forces of the Plane are concetrated here and must be destroyed. They are a barrier that must be overcome, crushed, exploded, shattered.
You control the fabled Ovoid. Your mission - Annihilation.
You thunder toward the looming defence, glittering, moving, as if it were alive. CRRRASSHH! It erupts in a shower of crystal, shimmering like a million diamonds falling around you. SSMMASSSH! It explodes again, ejecting strange moving forms for its defence.</Description>

		<Description>He's totally new. Totally tough. And he'll stop at nothing to make sure justice prevails! From the dark streets of GOTHAM CITY to the deepest corners of the criminal underworld comes the CAPED CRUSADER as you've never seen him before. Incredibly strong. Armed to the teeth. And ready to put his life on the line for the sake of all, on a search-and-destroy mission to end the Joker's reign of terror. He leaps, he flies, he dodges enemy fire and delivers it right back... with a vengeance. This is no kid stuff. This is as real as video gaming gets. If you liked what you saw in the movie, you're gonna love what you see here. Because this time around, BATMAN is all business, and he won't let anything stand in his way!</Description>

		<Description>The Penguin is back and he's set himself up as a respectable umbrella merchant. Or has he? Could the umbrella factory be just a cover for his plot to take over the world with an army of robotic penguins? As Batman you must match clues you've collected to locate the master computer and - POW! ZAP! CRUNCH! - put an end to the demented squawkings of that overweight birdbrain. But that's not all! As soon as you've taken care of the Penguin, the Joker pulls off his greatest feat of sleight of hand - he kidnaps Robin! At the scene of the crime you must gather all the facts. Then, while the trail is still hot, you're off on a crime-solving adventure. Grab your Batarang and rev up the Batmobile - because if you don't reach Robin in a hurry, the last laugh will be on you!

		<Description>The race begins! Drive your race-tuned Baja Bug along the race track, passing through gates and collecting flags for points. Time gates give you an additional two seconds on the next leg so drive through them if you can. Collecting the flags in the specified order gives you extra points. Avoid hitting the fences, walls, trees and other obstacles as they'll flip your buggy over and slow you down. You are competing against the clock so don't waste time, push the pedal flat to the floor. Try jumping obstacles by hitting the logs that lie across the track. Show off your driving skills by running over molehills and tree stumps, tipping your car onto two wheels - see how long you can keep your buggy in this trick position. Now fasten your seatbelt for the ride of your life!</Description>

		<Description>Hi kid, I hear ya got a computer at home. Real nice computer. Shame if anything should happen to it.
Stop staring, kid. I don't like bein' stared at. Aintcha never talked to a three-foot-high blue rabbit before? Anyway, like I wuz sayin' - ain't nuthin' gonna happen to dat nice computer of yours. Not if ya take advantage of my offer. First of all I wantcha ta buy dis game. Den I wantcha ta load it up. Den I wantcha ta help me ta take over all da mobs in Chicago.
Don't worry, it don't involve nuthin' illegal. Not unless ya count the odd bit of theft, extortion, murder, robbery, bribery an' corruption an' that sorta thing.
Right now I got nuthin'. No cash. Not even a gun. I wanna run da biggest gang in town. I wanna drive fancy cars an' live in plush hotels. I wanna be Public Enemy No. 1 in place of dat fat wimp Capone.
It ain't much to ask. Not if ya wanna keep dat computer healthy.</Description>

It's a whole new world of high-speed, split-screen action, as both of you take on the nasty Blaster-Trons infesting the planet Icarus. Yup, it's a tough mission all right, but you might just win out with the right blend of cooperation, courage, laser-hot reflexes, tactical sense and brains. There are 22 levels of savage and relentless action to battle through before you reach your objective, the central computer that's causing the evil infestation. You'll never get there, though, unless you put your heads together and cooperate; your buddy can't do it on his own and neither can you. This is one program where even the easy games are hard. So remember - united you stand, but divided you fall...</Description>

		<Description>The CK23 test development site is the most secret military complex on earth. Hidden somewhere on a mountainous and now deserted island, it is surrounded by deadly minefields, high voltage electric fences and survelliance cameras. The island itself is bristling with military activity, from armed foot patrols to roaming lethal tanks.
It is your mission to explore the island and find the heart of the development complex. Once there you must steal the design of the CK23 and then set a time delay bomb in the nuclear reactor. The explosion which follows will devastate the entire island.
The action takes place on a moonless night, hence you have been provided with a Sightless Image Enhancer (SIE) with head-up display. Using advanced 3D-vector graphics with full collision detection, you will see an accurate picture of your "world" as you move within it. You will be able to see and explore entire villages. Around any corner could lurk an armed guard or tank ready to despatch instant death. Being quick on the trigger is essential for survival.
It is also possible to enter and explore buildings - which may contain vital information or boobytraps. The civilian workforce hid a network of "spies". Unfortunately they have all been evacuated but you must understand their incredible mission if you are to succeed. This alone will test your powers of reasoning and deduction to the full.
Catch 23 is a vast game with one of the biggest challenges ever designed on a home microcomputer. It is the closest thing yet to actually being there.</Description>

		<Description>This is it. For the Championship. Last of the ninth, two on, two out. Down by one run and the crowd's going wild. You step into the batter's box, and their ace reliever uncorks his first pitch.
"STRIKE!"
With the pitch, your runners pull a double steal. A gutsy call, but now a single wins the game. "Ace" winds and delivers.
"STRIKE TWO!"
This guy means business. Time to get the lumber off your shoulder. His next pitch starts outside, but is breaking into the strike zone. You swing, and...
What happens? It's up to you and CHAMPIONSHIP BASEBALL. All the elements of real baseball are here - lineup changes, late inning excitement, and of course, big league action. Welcome to the major leagues of computer baseball.</Description>

Evil talismans hidden inside a castle have caused the dead to come back to life. If the spirits are not released quickly, they will mass into an army of the Undead and overtake the town! Creeping through the graveyard on your way to the castle, half-chewed arms and skulls with gnashing teeth attempt to stop you. Diabolical scenes greet you. Ever hear how a person sounds when in an iron maiden? But then you did say you wanted adventure, didn't you?</Description>

		<Description>Across the immeasurable void of space, an incredible fleet approaches the peaceful island planet of New Stratford. Just a speck on the civil radar system, a simple spacedozer ship was sent to survey the conundrum. With horror, the pilot of the asteroid demolition craft saw the radar speck become a huge invasion fleet. Then like a storm of meteors they were on him. Android fighters peppering his collision armour with a shower of missiles. Automatically he ploughed into them, crushing their super-structures like insect's thin shells. He cried out in fury and plummeted into a mothership, which ruptured into a blaze of dazzling plasma. "Death or Glory" he creamed triumphantly as his craft tore into the fleet.</Description>

		<Description>CAUTION: This cassette contains five of the most uninspired games to ever disgrace the 48K Spectrum.

RACE ACE - High speed motor racing action.

FIDO 1 - Supermutt versus the moles and the birdies.

WEASEL WILLY - Brilliant in its concept, unoriginal in its conception.

FIDO 2 - Puppy problems cause a right mess.

FRUIT MACHINE - Superb, original idea.

This probably the beginning of the end of games you have known them. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</Description>

		<Description>Life is hard when you're an Arcturan pilot. Life is dirty when you're an Arcturan pilot on a garbage reprocessing mission. As a result, little blue planets circling pretty yellow stars are a welcome relief. Whilst admiring a particularly blue planet near a very pretty star, your ship was pulled violently off-course by a tractor beam and you were dragged down onto the surface of a small, grey, alien moon. That was yesterday. Today, you have stolen a primitive alien craft and your only chance of escape is to neutralize the tractor beam so that you can release your own ship. Unfortunately, hordes of killer robots seem determined to stop you from doing so!</Description>

On hairpin turns to Tennessee, to the zero-visibility of a New England fog. And back. There is no finish line. Driver Qualifications: You never fear, never sleep. Your only goal in life is to break your own last record, rev that extra RPM, race that extra mile. Spend most of your time in fast lanes. Usually see competitors in your rear-view mirror. You are your own idol. The race is set. Are you?</Description>

		<Description>Hatched in a remote dancha in the forests outside Moscow, Plan Aurora is executed with relentless billiance and skill by a hand-picked team. A crack Soviet agent, placed under cover in Britain, begins to assemble the pieces of a jigsaw of devastation. Working blind on the faintest of clues, MI5 investigator John Preston leads an operation of the greatest urgency, racing against an unknown deadline.
In THE FOURTH PROTOCOL: The Game, you are John Preston. Your aim is to piece together the jigsaw, uncover the plot, and prevent the breaching of the Fourth Protocol, and stop Plan Aurora. In your task, you are able to access the on-line resources of CenCom, MI5's central communications computer, and use the services in the field of both MI5 and the intelligence networks of friendly nations. But too many wrong decisions and moves will lower Preston's prestige in the service and valuable field support will be withdrawn.
All three episodes of THE FOURTH PROTOCOL: The Game must be completed, against the deadline, before Plan Aurora is finally thwarted.</Description>

But snug in the chocolate fantasy he discovers the legendary "Chicken that Lays the Chocolate Eggs"... and from there the chase to catch the chicken is on! With Garfield skiing, skating and facing the trials of dealing with Odie, this is a unique blend of both arcade-style and adventure/puzzle-solving games.</Description>

Someone's got to stop it before it all gets out of hand... I mean, you just can't have bloodthirsty cyborg assassins roaming the streets and expect the citizens to put up with it. Who on earth is going to sort out the mess? You guessed - you get the job. Fortunately, you are just a little bit on the special side. You are Stryx, the product of Project Alpha Secure, the meanest fighting, smartest thinking machine ever invented. Half-man, half-robot, you are the business, the only one who can stop those wicked cyborgs. You'll have to work hard, though, blasting hordes of the revolting creatures and rescuing the keys to the Lifeforce. So, Stryx, you'd better get your jetpack on for some high level robot stomping through the immensely complex underground world of the Dome cities. It's a tough assignment and time is running out.</Description>

		<Description>There's a lot more to football than X's and O's. You haven't really experienced football until you've been down on the field, with an outside linebacker headed straight for you and nobody blocking him. There's a word for that experience - the word is pain. You haven't felt the real excitement of football until you've run the perfect pass pattern, broken free near the end zone, and caught the winning touchdown pass. There's a reward for that kind of performance - the reward is victory! You haven't seen real computer football until you've seen GFL Championship Football. It has what no other computer football program has: in-the-helmet perspective to put you down on the field, where the action is! Which is where you want to be if you're looking for real football. X's and O's were never like this!</Description>

		<Description>The time is yesteryear, when knights scoured the countryside in search of the Holy Grail, defended the honor of fair maidens and fought a never-ending battle against rampant evil forces. Thrown into this mayhem, is the courageous Sir Arthur. A victorious knight with the awesome task of penetrating the Demon's Castle to pulverize the Prince of Darkness. Can he do it? It's up to you. You'll dangerously travel through the Place of Execution, the Village of Decay, the Town of Fire, and the Crystal Forest with an arsenal of weapons at your side. And when you're really down on your luck, magic fights might with powerful results. The only problem? You'll have to learn how to use it. And avoid it. Because their magic has the power to change you into a helpless duck among other things. But there's not much time. Lives depend on you. So brandish your sword and make mincemeat of your foes.</Description>

Now, if you were a fully paid-up member of the notorious Guild of Thieves, things would be different. Mind you, it's not easy. You might find yourself ditched on a remote jetty by the Guildmaster. You might find that the Guild expects you to ransack a well guarded mansion. To go grave robbing. Potholing. Or maybe - if they're really doubtful of your abilities - everything at once! No problem, really, in a country full of helpful natives and friendly wildlife. Trouble is, you're not in a country like that. You're in Kerovnia. If you've played The Pawn, you'll remember Kerovnia. Except that the place seems to have gone downhill since then. But you'll find that out for yourself soon enough. And just one final hint - don't try any funny stuff. The Guildmaster has seen it all before. So has the Gatekeeper. So has the... But why should we give you any hints?</Description>

		<Description>No, you haven't been drafted. It's not that easy. It's nothing that safe. The country needs a big favoure. The CIA is counting on you to preserve Western Civilization. The Russians have in their possession a notebook known only as The Doomsday Papers. With it, they can bring the world to its knees.
Using your special investigative prowess, you must break into a place that is not exactly a tourist attraction. It's a maximum security complex located somewhere in Siberia. The good news is that you won't need a passport. The Bureau is lending you their satellite so you can get into the complex with your computer. They've even managed to infiltrate the building with a few droids called Mobile Remote Units (MRUs)
It seems easy enough, once you penetrate the security. Just move the MRUs from room to room. Locate the combinations to the safe. Find the safe. And remove the documents. But it's not that easy. In face, it's downright dangerous. There are video cameras and monitors to be avoided. Guard patrols. And something called... the annihilator. Plus, the only map is the one you've got to make while not being discovered by all of the above. That's why the government wants you. Your reputation got you into this mess. Your skill will have to get you out. There meter is running.</Description>

Standing in the shadow of the dark, dismal starship hovering silently above, we were completely unaware of the macabre fate that awaited us. No, the humans hadn't come in search of precious minerals. They had come for us. Radiation poisoning from a recent nuclear war has driven Earth's entire animal population into premature extinction, forcing the humans to scour new planets for livestock and laboratory specimens. Our fate is sealed, or is it? There is one last chance of survival. Hidden deep within the bowels of the planet lies an old escape pod. All you have to do is fight your way through the underground sewer to the escape pod, so you can fly to your neighbors for help. Should be no trouble for a superalien like you.

		<Description>Truth is stranger than fiction. Nastier too. The most horrendous murders ever to set alight the imagination of the public were not the inventions of a novelist or a film director. They took place in real life. In London. Almost exactly 100 years ago. This game - if game is the right word for it - uses the power of modern computer technology to create the atmosphere, the terror, of those dreadful months in 1888 when London was in the grip of the Ripper. Necessarily, the game contains scenes which will be disturbing and upsetting. Necessarily, the action takes place in an atmosphere of dread, anxiety and, at times, sheer nerve-shredding horror. If it did not it would not be truthful to the subject it deals with. If you are not fully prepared to undergo an experience which may at times be decidedly unpleasant, please do not buy this software package.</Description>

Cannons, tanks, submarines and snipers will blast you with horrific crossfire, while jet fighters zero in from above. To defend yourself, you control the army's advanced all-terrain attack jeep, with its arsenal of guided missiles and incendiary grenades. Of course these are merely tools, and to save your countrymen you'll need more than a handful of gunpowder. You'll need a pocketful of miracles, and the ferocity of a wild Jackal!</Description>

		<Description>Just when a man thinks his luck is running out, things start getting even worse. He gets run over by a bus. Sprayed with cheese sandwich by a supernatural being. Smashed against a tunnel by a speeding train. He gets incinerated, widdled on, folded, bent, spindled, mutilated and generally mucked about with. And in return? He gets the leading role in a perplexing, hilarious race against time and chance, set in a jinxed land menaced by the impending death of good fortune. Look on the bright side - it could be your luckiest move yet. Don't expect tiresome trolls, obvious orcs, silly spells and wet, wimpish witches in JINXTER. Infuriating, enchanting, absurd and hilarious by turns, JINXTER will surprise you with every move you make. But don't forget: every silver lining has a cloud.</Description>

All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life).
Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A).
Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about LOOPZ. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record.</Description>

		<Description>Follow us on Twitter: Elite_SystemsLords of Chaos (a game for 8-bit personal / home computers released in 1990) is one of THE defining games of the early 1990s.The Lords of Chaos app will be offered as an in-app purchase from within the Elite Collection app. (The in-app will be priced at £0.69/€0.79/US$0.99 and it may include one or more other 8-bit games).The Lords of Chaos app is also available in this stand-alone form. It does not include any other 8-bit games but it does include an infinite lives version.The Lords of Chaos app is the near-100% original 8-bit game, as programmed by Julian Gollop and published by Blade Software in 1990 and is brought to you - as an officially licenced product - utilizing our Elite Collection technology.Featuring:- portrait and landscape play / display modes- iDaptive (user-definable, game-specific joystick, keypad &amp; canvass) Controls- (Google: "Tiny URL 22qh8hl") for more info- ‘auto save’, on exiting the game- authentic '8-Bit' soundAbout Lords of Chaos (LoC): Lords of Chaos is a turn-based tactics game. It is the sequel to Chaos and an ancestor of the popular X-COM series of games, also written by Julian Gollop. In Lords of Chaos each player controls a wizard who can cast various magic spells. The spells have various effects, for example summoning other creatures (which the player also controls), or damaging opposing creatures and wizards. (In its original form the game could be played against a computer-controlled opponent or by up to four human players). Before embarking on the game's levels, the player is asked to design a wizard. This is done by splitting experience points amongst mana, action points, stamina, constitution, combat, defense and magic resistance. Remaining experience points are spent on spells. Spells may be offensive in nature (magic bolt, curse), potions (speed potion, healing potion), utility (teleport, magic eye) or summoning (goblin, unicorn, etc). These spells continue the theme from Chaos and include some of that game's more unusual elements (gooey blob, for example.) After completing each scenario, the player may spend accumulated experience points to further improve their wizard. The aim of each level of the game is for a player's wizard to reach a portal which appears after a preset number of turns. To do this, the player's wizard and creatures move around a map composed of square tiles, each of which represents one of various terrain types (for example, forest or the wall of a building). During a player's turn, only the parts of the map which that player's wizard or creatures have previously seen are shown, thus leading to other human players having to look away from the screen during each turn to avoid learning information they "shouldn't" know. Points are awarded for a player's wizard reaching the portal, for holding items of treasure (for example, valuable gems) when the wizard reaches the portal, or for enemy creatures killed during the level. Each level ends when all wizards have reached the portal or been killed, or when the portal disappears after a fixed number of turns (in which case all the remaining wizards lose). During each turn, each creature has a fixed number of action points which it can use to accomplish actions, for example moving, fighting hand-to-hand or shooting ranged weapons. When a creature's action points are used up for the turn, it can take no further actions until all the players have had a turn.About Elite®: Elite Systems Ltd was incorporated in England in 1984.</Description>

		<Description>Metrocross is the challenge that's been designed to inspire you. A chequered floor riddled with potholes, a barrage of obstacles that hinder your progress and no go areas that bring you to a standstill make this race against time increasingly impossible. But not everything is against you. Springboards are primed to catapult you forward and a speeding skateboard waits ready to hurtle you along that desperate rush to the finish line.
If you beat the clock the first time there's no guarantee you'll not be flattened at the next level.</Description>

		<Description>Infiltrate the criminal underworld - your mission is to seek out and destroy the kingpin of the MR. BIG CORPORATION - if you get that far. You'll have to outwit his enormous army of bodyguards, gangs of charisma-bypass patients in trench coats, the bullet brain with the build of a rhinoceros and the breath of a dung beetle, packs of vicious canine yappies, the psychotic clown with an evil sense of humor - you'll die, but not laughing! The there's the gas-guzzling cadillac jock - a cool specimen, elbow hanging on the door rail, a serious looking piece in his hand and ready to blow you away as he rolls down main street leaving you coughing blood. It's not all bad! You've got a chopper to back you up, a mean, shiny street machine, some heavy metal hardware and some pretty neat moves. And what about the kingpin... did I say he was Mr. Big? No, he's MR. BIG!</Description>

		<Description>Radiation from the sun caused terrible damage to the environment and forced people to retreat underground, safe from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. Vast subterranean cities evolved, but in isolation. Today, the only link between these underground cities is the old network of surface freeways now ruled by anarchic gangs of outcasts, known wholly as surface dwellers. The only people daring to make trips these days are the Overlanders. They are a breed apart. They keep themselves to themselves. Their only passion in life is their customized cars; pre-apocalypse vehicles dragged underground and rebuilt; rebuilt for speed and survival! They make journeys for cash, running cargo across the surface dwellers gauntlet. Life is improving the car, cargo's are carried for cash, cash means a better, faster, more powerful car...</Description>

A revolutionary text-handling system allows input of complicated sentences and complete interaction with characters (including some very intelligent animals!). The Pawn represents all its characters and objects as if they existed in a real world, storing complex information about their attributes and properties linked to their particular position or context in the game. Your objectives are manyfold: The simplest is to escape from Kerovnia, but you will find others as you wander about the land and communicate with the characters you meet. The Pawn combines a rich text adventure with stunning color graphics and a language parser that will set the standards for years to come!</Description>

		<Description>A sadistic crime wave is sweeping through Old Detroit. The situation is explosive - in fact, it is so bad a private corporation, O.C.P., has assumed control of the police force. Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named ROBOCOP! As ROBOCOP you are programmed to 1) Serve the public trust, 2) Uphold the law, and 3) Protect the innocent as you blast your way through city streets. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including ROBOCOP's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see ROBOCOP eliminated. Make your way past street thugs, the notorious Clarence Boddiker and the powerful Ed-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play! It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of Old Detroit - it's going to take ROBOCOP!</Description>

		<Description>He's back! Slightly returns in an authentic remake of the original classic arcade adventure.

Bigwiz the wizard has left the castle in a hurry, in order to turn the Kings son Newton back into a frog. Indeed, he was in such a hurry that he forgot to pack his spare wand, forgot to lock his laboratory door, and most importantly, forgot to return his utterly stupid, idiotic, incompetent, brain-dead nephew Slightly to his parents mud hut in the hills.

Oh well, it could be worse. A sunburnt dragon could be running off with the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak. The wizards spell cabinet might have been knocked over by a Flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering the spells everywhere. His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind panic, have given Slightly the wizards private spell book to read. It might rain.

You see, it could be worse. But as it is, theres not a cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragons breath to be sniffed. Hang on, wheres that pink fire-breathing creature going with that screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or is it something stronger?

Oh no. Get the washing in mother, and lock all doors. Cancel the papers, and shoot the cow. I think its going to be one of those days</Description>

		<Description>Spitfire 40 is not only the closest you're likely to come to flying one of the most famous aircraft of all time - it's  a spectacular war-time adventure as well.
Taking the part of a young Spitfire pilot in 1940, you must undergo thorough training in the techniques and practice of flying a Spitfire before going into practice combat and then full combat for real.
You can save all your practice and combat experiences too, allowing you to rise through the ranks of the RAF towards the coveted position of Group Captain, VC, OSO, and DFC.
Your personal pilot's log is included with the program, together with keyboard guide and quick-reference flight checklist.</Description>

		<Description>Stand by, Strider. Upon receiving your orders from the commander, you are dropped into the heart of Russia, armed with only your lightning-quick sword. Your task is to infiltrate the Red Army and return enemy secrets to your superiors. Your mission begins in Red Square, but after fighting off KGB attacks there, your clues lead you to the snow-capped mountains of Siberia to battle both the elements and the enemy. If you survive this icy test, your orders are to proceed south to the Lowlands where jungle tribes wait with spears and poison arrows. Now you must return to Moscow to face the Grand Master of the Red Army. It is vital that you get to him before he destroys you or the world will fall under Russian control. The free world relies on your success!</Description>

		<Description>Strike Force Harrier puts you in the cockpit for a full flight and combat simulation of one of Britain's most exciting fighter aircraft. Your objective is to bomb the enemy HQ, at the same time defending yourself and your ground sites from enemy aircraft and ground forces. You have cannon, bombs, and Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles at your disposal - but the enemy is just as well-armed as you are. You can select either practice or combat level, with a skill level of pilot, commander or ace. At the end of each mission your score is given, calculated on the basis of your distance from the enemy HQ.</Description>

		<Description>Space-security approaches the abandoned asteroid Stronghold, activating a volley of defense drones. Skillfully you must pilot your attack ship through the explosive space-waste; a single scrape will pierce the skin of your fragile ship. Without warning the bleak surface of the heavily-fortified Stronghold is energized by three moving force shields that protect a lethal asteroid crawler. The automatic systems of the seemingly derelict Stronghold are functioning perfectly, heat sensor interceptors launch to track and destroy your spacecraft. Survival depends on blasting through the whirling force shields and devastating the crawling command center as it fires repeatedly trying to eliminate your frail ship.</Description>

		<Description>Open the throttle fully and 'pull g'. Your turbo-charged V8 engine hugs barked curves before climbing up and away off a ramp hundreds of feet above the ground. Glide past your opponent in mid-air before crashing back onto the track, your chassis shuddering and tyres squealing. No time to look back  - the next bend looms and you're still not in full control!
As a Stunt Car Racer, you're blasting around eight roller-coaster tracks at over two hundred miles per hour, pitting your wits and high speed driving skills against computer controlled opponents or a friend via a datalink cable, all in amazingly fast, smooth 3-D graphics.
If you survive to become Division One champion, you're in the Superleague with a machine twice as powerful. Stop your car breaking up under the strain and then accelerate still further. There are no prizes for second place in this game - It's all or nothing!</Description>

		<Description>The Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles are out to rescue lovely April O'Neil, who's been captured by Shredder - a maniac more menacing than an army of mind-altered Bruce Lees. But if they're to succeed, you must command the role of each turtle, rumbling through 6 New York territories patrolled by Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly Foot Clan. Along the way you'll encounter Mouser infested sewers, criminally polluted rivers, and villainous streets run by the terrorist team of Rocksteady and Bebop. So grab your nunchukus and prepare to put yourself in someone else's shell. Because in this to-the-death adventure, you'll control every leap, chop, slice and dice, until you knock heads with Shredder and either splatter him senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup.</Description>

		<Description>It comes from the future. It can take any shape and survive almost any injury (even when a 10-gauge shotgun blast opens it up like a tin can). Its mission: eliminate John Connor. Its name: the T-1000. Against it stands one hope: you, a terminator model T-800... equipped with on-screen target search displays, a lever-action Winchester, and 10 barrels of high explosives... one mean machine. Protect John Connor (before a 23,000 lb. tow-rig plows your Harley into tomorrow). Save humanity (while Uzi-armed SWAT teams try to blow you away). Terminate the T-1000 (steel mill metldown!)... or mankind is history.</Description>

		<Description>The Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles are out to rescue lovely April O'Neil, who's been captured by Shredder - a maniac more menacing than an army of mind-altered Bruce Lees. But if they're to succeed, you must command the role of each turtle, rumbling through 6 New York territories patrolled by Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly Foot Clan. Along the way you'll encounter Mouser infested sewers, criminally polluted rivers, and villainous streets run by the terrorist team of Rocksteady and Bebop. So grab your nunchukus and prepare to put yourself in someone else's shell. Because in this to-the-death adventure, you'll control every leap, chop, slice and dice, until you knock heads with Shredder and either splatter him senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup.</Description>

Any knight or warrior who dared to face dragon and his fiery breath was instantly reduced to ashes. Seeing that the brute force alone cannot rid the kingdom of the malevolent beast, sorceress Vanda left the castle with a plan to bring some help. 

But weeks are passing and Vanda is still not coming back, so our unlikely hero Towdie decides to take things into his own hands. His task is not easy however.

		<Description>The year is 2525. An attacking force of alien space stations approach Earth. Scanners indicate that a direct assault would be useless. You must infiltrate and destroy the invaders with the most powerful battle tanks ever created: Vindicators. For one or two gamers, Vindicators blows you away with incredible action and graphics as you blast your way through each station. Your mission: locate and destroy its control room. Power up your tank with special features such as enhanced speed, shot range, shot power, force field or even "Smart Shots." Keep replenishing your tank's fuel supply. Once you're out of gas, you're out! Destroy all the enemy stations and you'll face the evil Emperor of the alien empire in a final showdown. Win and the world cheers with you. Lose and kiss it goodbye.</Description>

		<Description>The whole of J.R.R. Tolkien's panoramic vision has been included in this epic game. Follow in the footsteps of Frodo, Aaragorn and Gandalf as they battle to get the ring to the Cracks of Doom. Ranged against you are all the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron and the corrupt wizard Saruman. The odds are overwhelming, but you cannot aford to fail. The destiny of Middle Earth lies in the balance. Multiple playing levels let you control all the characters and armies that appear in "The Lord of the Rings" from the broad sweep of strategy, right down to individual characters' actions on the battlefield. There are infinite possibilities so no two games will ever be the same. Gripping action means you will always want another game. Guard carefully and travel well, my friend. May the fellowship of the ring be successful, and peace return to all Middle Earth.</Description>

		<Description>The chief of intelligence has been kidnapped. The CIA is counting on your natural survival skills and the hunter's instincts of the Black Panther, the magnificent predator trained especially for your protection, to go and find the chief. Not just one man's life is at stake, but the complete CIA operations network is being undermined. Right now the mafia's terrorists are torturing their prisoner in order to get the names of the agents leading the fight against organized crime and drug dealing. Both you and your ally are deposited, by helicopter, near the spot where the chief was last seen before his disappearance. Prepare yourself for a fight to the death, but remember to only use your gun when all else fails.</Description>

		<Description>Are you ready to step into the world of Wizardry? Unmatched by any other fantasy role-playing game, the Wizardry Gaming System allows for unlimited combinations of strategies and tactics, so that each quest into the Maze is always fresh and interesting.
Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first Wizardry scenario. Starting in the Castle, you assemble one to six adventurers to explore the magic and mystery of the ten-level 3-D Maze. Your characters may be one of five races and eight professions, each with strengths and weaknesses.
Under your command, brawny warriors, frail magis, pious clerics, and nimble thieves accumulate experience and treasure. As your characters gain experience, they develop greater capabilities to become even better adventurers, allowing them to venture deeper into the Maze.
Be wary! The treacherous Maze has some tricks and traps of its own. Hundreds of monsters, many with magical powers equal to your own; pits; chutes; rotating rooms; teleporters; special one-of-a-kind surprises; and much more will keep you on your toes for many hours of fun. May luck and good fortune be your companions!</Description>

		<Description>Your awesome task is to save your race from extinction. Deep beneath the desolate surface of your ancestral home you begin your quest.
Scattered about a vast subterranean complex are the constituent sections of DNA, which, when assembled, form the vital chain that enables your people to thrive once more.
You must explore this complex to locate and collect the DNA. However, the complex is not without defence against intruders. Apparitions, formed from pure energy into a myriad of strange guises, inhabit the complex. Contact with them proves fatal. However, you still have three clones into which your consciousness may be transferred. You will also find orbs strewn about the complex, you must discover their secrets.
Each room has sealed energy doors which must be neutralised before you may pass.
On collection of the final piece of DNA the genetic-chamber has its doors revealed. You must enter and rid the chamber of apparitions; only then will your race be saved.</Description>

		<Description>Join Major Rock Hardy and Captain Ace Gunn in their battle for supremacy against an army of invading Xybots! With a split-screen for one or two players and a unique viewing area, you'll find Xybots a challenging strategic blast-'em-up! It's non-stop action all the way and working together in two-player mode is the ultimate fun. Each player controls one character and the split-screen gives each his own playing area. A map shows the section you're battling through and the positions of the patrolling Xybots. And to keep one step ahead, pick up energy pods, super weapons, keys and coins.</Description>

		<Description>For a bear that's smarter than the average, life in Jellystone Park should be one long picnic. After all, everyone knows picnics mean picnic baskets! But life has taken a nasty turn. Poor little lovable Boo Boo has been "bearnapped" by a bloodthirsty hunter and is a prisoner somewhere in the Park! Heroic as ever, Yogi is on Boo Boo's trail. But Jellystone's a big place and you'll have to find plenty of tasty snacks to keep our trusty bear's strength up. Especially since along the way Yogi's pursued by angry campers, a furious Ranger, ferocious animals and homicidal hunters! Time's getting short too. Yogi's hibernation season is nearly here. So you'll need speed and a lot of bare (ouch!) cunning to rescue Boo Boo before Yogi slumps into his slumbers.</Description>
